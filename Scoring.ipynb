Today's call is being recorded.  And now at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Gala, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.  Before turning the call over to Tim, I would like to remind everyone that the December quarter spanned 14 weeks, while the March quarter, as usual, has 13 weeks. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operations.  These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.  I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\\nTimothy Cook: Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us.  Today, we're reporting revenue of $117.2 billion for the December quarter. We set all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, Spain, Turkey and Vietnam, along with quarterly records in Brazil and India. As a result of a challenging environment, our revenue was down 5% year-over-year. But I'm proud of the way we have navigated circumstances, seen and unforeseen, over the past several years, and I remain incredibly confident in our team and our mission and in the work we do every day.  Let me discuss the 3 factors that impacted our revenue performance during the quarter. The first was foreign exchange headwinds, which had a nearly 800 basis point impact. On a constant currency basis, we grew year-over-year and would have grown in the vast majority of the markets we track.  The second factor, which we described in a November 6 update was COVID-19-related challenges, which significantly impacted the supply of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and lasted through most of December. Because of these constraints, we had significantly less iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max supply than we planned, causing ship times to extend far beyond what we had anticipated. As we always have every step of the way throughout the pandemic, we continued to prioritize people and worked with our suppliers to ensure the health and safety of every worker. Production is now back where we want it to be.  The third factor was a challenging macroeconomic environment as the world continues to face unprecedented circumstances, from inflation to war in Eastern Europe, to the enduring impacts of the pandemic. And we know that Apple is not immune to it. But whatever conditions we face, our approach is always the same. We are thoughtful and deliberate. We manage for the long term. We adapt quickly to circumstances outside our control while delivering with excellence in the things we can. We invest in innovation, in people and in the positive difference we can make in the world. And we do it all to provide our customers with technology that will enrich their lives and help unlock their full creative potential. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of, and it's so rewarding for all of us at Apple when we hear how much our customers are loving what we create.  Let me talk now about what we saw across our product categories. Starting with iPhone. Revenue came in at $65.8 billion for the quarter, down 8% year-over-year. However, on a constant currency basis, iPhone revenue was roughly flat. Our customers continue to rave about the astounding camera capabilities and unprecedented battery life and the groundbreaking suite of health and safety features. The iPhone 14 lineup pushes the limits of what users can do with a smartphone.  During the quarter, Mac revenue came in at $7.7 billion, which was in line with what we had expected. We had a difficult compare because this time last year, we had the extremely successful launch of the redesigned M1 MacBook Pros. We also faced a challenging macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange headwinds. We remain confident in and focused on the long-term opportunity for Mac.  Just last month, we introduced new MacBook Pro models powered by our latest developments in Apple silicon, M2 Pro and M2 Max. These chips enable unprecedented performance and do so with less energy, which is not only good for the environment but gives the newest MacBook Pro the longest battery life ever in a Mac. We also introduced the M2-powered Mac mini, which will supercharge productivity for users of all kinds and leave them stunned by just how powerful a Mac mini can be.  During the quarter, iPad revenue grew 30% to a total of $9.4 billion. The very strong growth was due in part to a favorable compare to the December quarter a year ago when we experienced significant supply constraints. Customers continue to praise our new lineup for its versatility, whether it's the new iPad Pro now powered by the M2 or the newly designed iPad 10th Generation with its stunning liquid retina display and beautiful colors.  Revenue for Wearables, Home and Accessories was $13.5 billion, which was down 8% year-over-year driven by foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in the category. As an example, a few weeks ago, we announced the next-generation HomePod, which is an indispensable addition to the smart home. This powerful smart speaker relies on advanced computational audio to produce an incredible listening experience. We're also helping users make their homes safer with sound recognition. This feature, arriving later this spring, allows HomePod to send a notification directly to a user's iPhone if a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm sound is identified.  We continue to hear wide praise for Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra, which has set a new standard for what's possible with a wearable. From a whole host of health and safety features to incredible new capabilities for extreme athletes, there is something for everyone in these amazing products. Customers are excited about some phenomenal new features we've made available across many of our products as well. One of the highlights is emergency SOS via satellite, which launched for iPhone 14 customers in the U.S. and Canada in November and for customers in France, Germany, Ireland and the U.K. in December. This is a feature we hope our users will never need, but it is incredibly heartening to get e-mails from people describing the life-saving impact our new safety features have had on them.  We're always looking for new ways to empower people to create and collaborate. In December, we released Freeform, a brand-new app that lets users take their ideas wherever they want, anywhere they are, all while collaborating in real time. Freeform has already received praise from reviewers for its flexibility and simplicity as it works seamlessly across iPhone, iPad and Mac.  Today, we are very excited to announce that we've achieved a truly incredible milestone. Thanks to our deep commitment to innovation, incredible customer loyalty and satisfaction and a large number of switchers, we now have more than 2 billion active devices as part of our growing installed base, double what it was just 7 years ago. This is an incredible testament to our products and services and the strength of our ecosystem.  We set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion in services, which was better than what we had expected. We achieved double-digit revenue growth from App Store subscriptions and set all-time revenue records across a number of categories, including cloud and payment services. All told, Apple now has more than 935 million paid subscriptions.  Apple has also just begun a historic 10-year partnership with Major League Soccer. Just yesterday, we launched MLS Season Pass, which will give fans in more than 100 countries access to every live MLS regular season game as well as the playoffs and MLS Cup, all with no blackouts. And while we're providing more content to sports fans than ever before, Apple TV+ continues to showcase powerful characters and moving storytelling. We were thrilled to celebrate the holidays alongside our Apple TV+ subscribers with the hit movie Spirited. And we're delighted to see how much people are enjoying new and returning series like Shrinking, Slow Horses and Truth Be Told. And we have some great upcoming movies in Sharper and Tetris, along with Emmy Award winner Ted Lasso returning this spring.  During the quarter, we made some great updates to Fitness+ as well, expanding our catalog of more than 3,500 workouts and meditations to include a new kickboxing category and a new sleep theme for meditations. Our latest artist spotlight series features the music of the incomparable Beyonce, and we're excited to take a stroll with guests appearing on our fifth season of Time to Walk. And we continue to build on our decades-long commitment to helping small businesses thrive when we announced Apple Business Connect. This new tool gives business owners even more control over how billions of people see and engage with their products and services every day. Businesses of all sizes can now customize key information for users across Apple Maps, Messages, Wallet, Siri and other apps.  Meanwhile, in retail, we celebrated 25 years of the Apple online store and also opened Apple Pacific Centre in Vancouver and Apple American Dream in New Jersey. And I'm grateful to all the teams who helped our customers throughout the busy holiday season. At Apple, we spend a lot of time focused on creating an unparalleled experience for our customers and every product and service that we offer. We're also just as dedicated to leading with our values in everything we do. As part of that work, we strengthened our deep commitment to privacy and security, giving users 3 new tools to protect their most sensitive data: iMessage contact key verification, security keys for Apple ID and advanced data protection for iCloud.  At Apple, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to leave the world better than we found it. We're also a year closer to 2030, and we were ever focused on the environmental commitments we set out for the end of the decade. As an example, the latest Mac mini and MacBook Pro models all use 100% recycled aluminum in the enclosure and recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. And in a first for HomePod, we're using 100% recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards. In honor of Black History Month, we released the Black Unity collection, including the Special Edition Apple Watch Black Unity Sport Loop, a new matching watch face and iPhone wallpaper. Through our racial, equity and justice initiative, we're expanding our support of 5 organizations focused on lifting up communities of color through technology. And we are committed as ever to building on our progress around inclusion and diversity.  During the quarter, we also announced that since the inception of our Giving program 11 years ago, we've donated more than $880 million to humanitarian efforts, disaster relief, childhood education and more. And over the last 16 years through our partnership with (RED), Apple-supported grants have helped more than 11 million people get the care and support services they need.  As we look ahead in 2023, we are excited about the year to come. At Apple, we are always looking forward, always focused on the next challenge, always determined to do great things with unmatched creativity and unrivaled innovation. And that makes me more confident about the future of Apple than I have ever been.  With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tim mentioned, revenue for the December quarter was $117.2 billion, down 5% from last year. A number of factors had a significant impact on our results. First, we faced a very difficult foreign exchange environment, which affected our performance by nearly 800 basis points. In other words, we grew revenue on a constant currency basis. And in fact, we did so in the vast majority of markets.  Second, the macroeconomic environment this past quarter was markedly more challenging than 12 months ago. Third, we experienced significant supply shortages for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max in November and through December. On the other hand, we had the positive impact of the 14th week in the quarter that Tejas just mentioned at the beginning of the call.  Products revenue was $96.4 billion, down 8% from last year due to the factors I just called out. At the same time, however, our installed base of active devices grew double digits and achieved all-time records in each geographic segment and in each major product category. We're proud to now have over 2 billion active devices in our installed base. This continued growth in the installed base is due to extremely strong levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products.  The installed base growth also helped our services set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion, up 6% over a year ago. We achieved this new milestone despite more than 700 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. We reached all-time services revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Pacific and a December quarter record in Greater China. We also set records in many Services categories, including all-time revenue records for cloud services, payment services and music and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. Company gross margin was 43%, up 70 basis points from last quarter due to leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 37%, up 240 basis points sequentially. And Services gross margin was 70.8%, up 30 basis points sequentially, both due to the same factors that impacted total company gross margin.  Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were significantly below the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and grew at a slower pace than in the past as we took actions to respond to the current macro environment. Net income was $30 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.88, and we generated very strong operating cash flow of $34 billion.  Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $65.8 billion despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, supply constraints on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In spite of these circumstances, we set all-time iPhone revenue records in Canada, Italy and Spain, and saw strong growth in several emerging markets, including all-time iPhone revenue records for India and Vietnam. Importantly, the installed base of active iPhones continues to grow nicely and is at an all-time high across all geographic segments.  In emerging markets, in particular, the installed base grew double digits, and we had record levels of switchers in India and in Mexico. Our customers continue to love their experience with our products with the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 14 family.  Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, down 29% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. There were 3 key drivers for our Mac results. First, we had a challenging compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined MacBook Pros, our first notebooks with M1 Pro and M1 Max. Second, we believe that the macro environment impacted our Mac performance. And third, we faced significant foreign exchange headwinds. At the same time, however, the installed base of active Macs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, and we continue to see very strong upgraded activity to Apple silicon. Customer satisfaction with Mac remains very strong at 96% based on the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research.  iPad revenue was $9.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year despite significant FX headwinds. This performance was driven by 2 key items. First, during the December quarter a year ago, we experienced significant supply constraints, while this year, we had enough supply to meet demand. Second, we launched our new iPad and the iPad Pro powered by the M2 chip during the quarter. The iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product.  Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $13.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was driven by significant FX headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. However, our installed base of devices in the category set a new all-time record thanks to the largest number of customers new to our smartwatch that we've ever had in a given quarter. In fact, nearly 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product.  Moving to Services. We generated $20.8 billion in revenue, a new all-time record in total and for many Services offerings in spite of a difficult foreign exchange environment, and macroeconomic headwinds impacting certain categories such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. In constant currency, we grew Services revenue double digits on top of growing 24% during the December quarter a year ago.  We remain focused on the large long-term opportunity in this category, and we continue to observe several trends that reflect the strength of our ecosystem. For example, we saw increased customer engagement with our Services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each setting a new all-time record.  Paid subscriptions also continued to grow nicely. We now have more than 935 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up more than 150 million during the last 12 months alone and nearly 4x what we had just 5 years ago.  And we continue to increase the reach and improve the quality of our offerings. For instance, Apple Pay is now available to millions of merchants in nearly 70 countries and regions. And we saw a record-breaking number of purchases made using Apple Pay globally during the holiday shopping season.  Finally, our installed base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem, and it continues to grow even during difficult macroeconomic conditions, which speaks to the exceptionally high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction and our ability to attract new customers to our platform. The growth is coming from every major product category and geographic segment, with strong double-digit increases in emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.  Turning to the enterprise market. we are seeing continued adoption of our Services for business like Apple Business Essentials, AppleCare, Tap to Pay and Apple Financial Services. For example, Mars Incorporated has expanded its use of AppleCare for Enterprise to provide timely device support and assurance for iPads deployed across their manufacturing sites. Meanwhile, HCA Healthcare has leveraged Apple Financial Services to manage the annual refresh of its entire fleet of iPhones. This not only ensures that their staff stay current on the latest Apple technology, but also provides them with significant annual savings in the process.  Let me now turn to our capital return program and our cash position. We returned over $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter as our business continues to generate very strong cash flow. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19 billion through open market repurchases of 133 million Apple shares. We ended the quarter with $165 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1.4 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8.2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $54 billion at the end of the quarter, and we maintain our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time.  As we move into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.  In total, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the December quarter. This represents an acceleration in our underlying year-over-year business performance as the December quarter benefited from an extra week. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of 5 percentage points.  For Services, we expect revenue to grow year-over-year while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. For iPhone, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to accelerate relative to the December quarter year-over-year revenue performance. For Mac and iPad, we expect revenue for both product categories to decline double digits year-over-year because of challenging compares and macroeconomic headwinds.  We expect gross margin to be between 43.5% and 44.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $100 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%.  Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock payable on February 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2023.  With that, let's open the call to questions.\\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, may we have the first question, please.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from David Vogt with UBS.\\nDavid Vogt: So Tim, and maybe this is for Luca as well. You talked about the supply chain returning back to normal after a very difficult October, November, but we're still seeing some disruptions across tech products, whether it's enterprise or consumer-facing. How do you think about your supply chain and maybe the levels of inventory or builds that you might need as we go forward to sort of insulate your business from these sort of episodic disruptions? Have you changed your view? And if so, how does that affect ultimately margins and sort of your balance sheet and cash flow items going forward?\\nTimothy Cook: This is Tim, David. From a supply point of view, we did see disruption from early November through most of December. And from a supply chain point of view, we're now at a point where production is what we need it to be. And so the problem is behind us.  In terms of going forward in the supply chain, we build our products everywhere. There are component parts coming from many different countries in the world, and the final assembly coming from 3 countries in the world on just iPhone. And so we continue to optimize it. We'll continue to optimize it over time and change it to continue to improve.  I think when you sort of zoom out and back up from it, the last 3 years have been a pretty difficult time between COVID and silicon shortages and the like. And I think it's -- I think we have had a very resilient supply chain in the aggregate.  In terms of supply for this quarter, which I think was one of your points, I think we're in decent supply on most products for the quarter currently.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse.\\nShannon Cross: Luca, I wanted to dig a bit more into the commentary on gross margins. The guidance, especially at 43.5% to 44.5%, is obviously quite strong. So I'm wondering what's helping you out there, assume mix and some other things. And then how should we think about what currency and hedge is going to do as we look forward? And then I have a follow-up.\\nLuca Maestri: Shannon, yes, I mean, we've had good margin for the December quarter to start with. We reported 43%. Obviously, in December, we have the benefit of leverage because of the seasonality of the business, but we also had favorable mix across the board.  Of course, foreign exchange is an issue right now. In the December quarter on a sequential basis, foreign exchange was a negative 110 basis points for us. And on a year-over-year basis, it's 300 basis points. So obviously, the FX environment has changed a lot during the last 12 months.  For March, yes, we've seen a margin expansion, 43.5% to 44.5%. We're doing a lot of work around cost, of course. Mix will continue to help, both within categories and services mix as we move away from the holiday season. But we're doing a lot of work on the cost structure, and that is paying off. Foreign exchange is still a negative, about 50 basis points sequentially, but it's mitigating. The last couple of weeks, the dollar has weakened a bit. And so hopefully, as we go through the year, hopefully, things will improve. But for now, as you correctly state, we are in a good position on margins.\\nShannon Cross: And then, Tim, can you talk a bit about China? What you're seeing -- obviously, you've had the issues with production, but I mean more on the demand side. As we've gotten through Chinese New Year and the opening, I'm just wondering, are you seeing the Chinese consumer come back? What are they buying? And how are you thinking about your position there?\\nTimothy Cook: Shannon, last quarter, we declined by 7% on a reported basis, but we actually grew on a constant currency basis. And that was despite some significant -- the supply constraints that we talked about earlier. And obviously, the sort of the COVID restrictions throughout China that happened in various different places throughout the country also impacted the demand during the quarter.  When you look at the opening that started happening in December, we saw a marked change in traffic in our stores as compared to November. And that followed through to demand as well. And I don't want to get into January. We've obviously -- January is included in the guidance, or the color rather, that Luca provided earlier. But we did see a marked change from December compared to November.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley.\\nErik Woodring: Maybe, Tim, first one for you. That 2 billion installed base -- device installed base figure, that's up, I believe, 200 million units year-over-year. That implies the strongest annual gain in new devices in your installed base basically as far back as you've provided those data points. And so I guess my 2 questions are: one, do you -- can you provide the installed base for the iPhone at year-end? And then two, is there anything that you see in this new cohort of users that might look different or similar to past cohorts, either by demographic or regions or monetization ramp? And then I have a follow-up.\\nTimothy Cook: Yes. The installed base is now over 2 billion active devices, as you mentioned. And we set records across each geographic segment and major product category. And so it was a broad-based change. Two -- I'll correct one thing you said, it's up over 150 million year-over-year. The last report we reported to be over 1.85. And so it's 150 million, which we're very proud of. We also saw strong double-digit in several of the emerging markets, which is very important to us. For example, India and Brazil as just 2 examples. So very, very strong. And obviously, it bodes well for the future.\\nErik Woodring: And then, Luca, obviously, the December quarter was negatively impacted by the production challenges. Can you just maybe unpackage where channel inventory levels are today kind of across the iPhone broadly? And then what the data that you're seeing so far this quarter is telling you about iPhone demand deferral versus kind of iPhone demand destruction and perhaps pushing some upgrades later into the year rather than into the March quarter? And that's it for me.\\nTimothy Cook: Yes. Erik, I'll take that one as well. The channel inventory levels on iPhone, we obviously ended the December quarter below our target range given the supply challenges on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. But as you think about this, keep in mind that a year ago, we also exited the December quarter below our target inventory range because of supply challenges in the year ago quarter. Not related -- not the same issue, but just as a point. And so that hopefully gives you some flavor of that.  In terms of what we're seeing in January, we've included in our color that Luca provided kind of our thinking. It's very hard to estimate the recapture because you have to know exactly what would have happened and how many people bought down. And it takes a while to get that -- to get those reports in during the quarter. And so we've made our best guess at it.  In terms of the sizing of the constraint in Q1, what we estimate, although not with precision, is that we would -- I thought we believe iPhone would have grown during the quarter had it not been for the supply shortages. So hopefully, that provides you a little bit of color.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.\\nAaron Rakers: I have two as well, if I can. I guess the first kind of question, just going back on the gross margin line. Pretty good guidance into this March quarter. I'm curious if you unpack that a little bit specific around what you're seeing as far as maybe benefits from component pricing in the guidance, if you're embedding any of that at this point.\\nLuca Maestri: Yes. Of course, with our guidance, we try to capture every aspect of our cost structure. And obviously, components are a big portion of that. So definitely, that's included. And keep in mind, again, that foreign exchange -- I mentioned earlier, I think to Shannon, that the sequential negative on FX is 50 basis points, versus a year ago, it's 270 basis points. Obviously, the U.S. dollar has moved a lot over the last 12 months. So obviously, we need to find offsets and more to the negative FX in order to be able to provide this kind of guidance. And so obviously, components are a big part of that.\\nAaron Rakers: Yes. And then kind of from a strategic perspective, given kind of the things that we're seeing out in some of your peer group, I'm curious, Tim, how you think about the role of AI in your strategy as far as particularly in the Services segment, whether you're not -- you see opportunities to excel monetization abilities within the paid subscriber base and whether or not AI, is it something that you're implementing a bit more strategically there.\\nTimothy Cook: Yes. It is a major focus of ours. It's incredible in terms of how it can enrich customers' lives. And you can look no further than some of the things that we announced in the fall with crash detection and fall detection or back a ways with ECG. I mean these things have literally saved people's lives. And so we see an enormous potential in this space to affect virtually everything we do. It's obviously a horizontal technology, not a vertical. And so it will affect every product and every service that we have.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore.\\nAmit Daryanani: I guess the first one I have is, Tim, I think based on your earlier comments that iPhones would have grown ex the production issue that implied that maybe it's a $7 billion or so impact that you had in December quarter from the production challenges on the high-end models. I'm sure it's tough to see what happens this time around. But I think historically, when you've had production issues or things like this happen, what has the consumer behavior being typically? Do they tend to go down towards the lower end models and get the phone they want quickly? Or do they just defer the production? Just from a historical perspective, I think do you typically recover what's deferred out or no?\\nTimothy Cook: It's very hard to estimate is the real answer because you have to know a lot of data, and it's usually only in hindsight that you have a more reasonable view of it. And so we put our best views in the color that Luca provided. That's kind of what I would say.\\nAmit Daryanani: All right. And then I guess maybe if I think about Services as you go forward. I know you had really good growth in Services, I think, over the last several years. But as you go forward in Services, what do you think drives the growth more so? Is it the expansion of your installed base? Or is it more going to be driven by ARPU going higher for you? I'm just curious, how do you think about those 2 buckets as you go forward?\\nLuca Maestri: Amit, there's a number of things, and I've mentioned a few of them during the call. The first step is always the installed base. Installed base is the engine for Services growth. And the fact that the installed base is growing very nicely, and it's growing in a lot of emerging markets, it's growing even faster, that gives us a larger addressable pool of customers. So that's incredibly important.  The second one is that we are seeing that the level of engagement of our customers already in our ecosystem continues to grow. We -- I mentioned that both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits. And so that bodes very well for the future. And we have a lot of transacting accounts that kind of moved to paid accounts over time.  The other aspect that is very important for us is to continue constantly to improve the reach and the quality of our services. And I give the example of Apple Pay, which it's a great example because we started off primarily in the United States. Now we've taken it to 70 markets, millions of merchants. And so obviously, payment services are -- continue to set new highs all the time for us.  And then as you've seen over the last few years, we also launched new services over time, and that obviously contributes to the growth. We're very excited. And when we look at the behavior of our installed base, we think it's very promising for the continued growth of our Services business.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler.\\nHarsh Kumar: Tim, I had a quick question on emerging markets. Seems like you're making a lot of strides in India. Potentially wanted to understand the kind of share you have in China and India. And relative to that, what would be your aspirational but sort of achievable share in iPhones in those territories, whether it's units or revenues? And I was hoping to draw on your experience and maybe what you've seen in other countries where you've had some longer presence.\\nTimothy Cook: And looking at the business in India, we set a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year-over-year. And so we feel very good about how we performed, and that was -- that's despite the headwinds that we've talked about. Taking a step back, India is a hugely exciting market for us and is a major focus. We brought the online store there in 2020. We will soon bring Apple retail there. So we're putting a lot of emphasis on the market. There's been a lot done from a financing options and trade-ins to make products more affordable and give people more options to buy. And so there's a lot going on there.  We are, in essence, taking what we learned in China years ago and how we scale to China and bringing that to bear. And I don't have the exact market shares in front of me, but I think you would see that from a market share point of view that we grew around the world last quarter despite -- on iPhone despite the challenges that we've had on the supply side. And I wouldn't expect to have a difference in those 2 markets.\\nHarsh Kumar: Understood. And for my follow-up, I had a sort of interesting theoretical question on pricing. Assuming we get the CHIPS Act passed, and there's a whole bunch of manufacturing that happens in U.S. and other territories that are potentially somewhat more expensive than the ones you might be now, have you -- has the company done any studies to gauge the elasticity of demand relative to small price increases in your products?\\nTimothy Cook: We have experience in that, but I wouldn't necessarily draw the same conclusion that you have in terms of the cost of the product. I -- we don't know at this point exactly what that will be, but we're all in, in terms of being the largest customer for TSMC in Arizona. I'm very proud to take part in that. That's what I would say about that.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.\\nWamsi Mohan: Tim, you've done a phenomenal job of driving consumer choice towards higher-end products within your portfolio. How would you compare this cycle for iPhones if you were to segment the Pro versus non-Pro models versus the cycles from the past few years? And do you think this move to higher ASPs is sustainable? Or do you think it reverses in a tighter consumer spending environment? And I have a follow-up.\\nTimothy Cook: The Pro has been a -- the 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max have done extremely well up until the point where we had a supply shortage and couldn't provide them -- couldn't provide the total of the demand. And so it's definitely a strong Pro cycle. I think there's a number of reasons for that, but the most important one is always the product. And I think the innovations and the product speak for themselves. And we feel very good about the product that we announced back in September and are happy to now be at a point where we're shipping to the demand.\\nWamsi Mohan: And Tim, do you think that this move to sort of higher ASPs that has happened over the last few years is sustainable? Or could it sustain in this very tough macro environment that you've cited?\\nTimothy Cook: I wouldn't want to predict, but I would say that the smartphone for us, the iPhone has become so integral into people's lives. It contains their contacts and their health information and their banking information and their smart home and so many different parts of their lives, their payment vehicle and -- for many people. And so I think people are willing to really stretch to get the best they can afford in that category.\\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Great. And Tim, you clearly emphasize the focus and importance of the installed base. If we think about the absolute grit of the installed base from 1 billion to 2 billion over 7 years from a device standpoint, how should we think about the penetration of services or the growth in paying customers on services or that time frame? Is that penetration rate increasing or decreasing? How fast is that growing relative to the growth of the overall installed base?\\nLuca Maestri: Wamsi, it's Luca. Yes, of course, we keep track of that. It's really important for us. Over the last 7 years, as we doubled the installed base, we've seen a growing engagement of our customers on the platform. That happens, first of all, by customers transacting on the platform and then moving to paid accounts. So starting to pay for some of the services. That percentage of paid accounts tends to grow over time. We've seen it in developed markets. We see it in emerging markets. And that is due to some of the reasons that I was explaining earlier, including the fact that we made it easier for our customers to get engaged on the platform. For example, we offer multiple payment methods in many countries. And we've made it easier to explore for more services because we've added a lot of services on the platform over the last 7 years. So to your question, of course, higher engagement means a higher percentage of paid accounts over time.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Kramer of Arete Research LLP.\\nTejas Gala: Operator, can we move on to the next?\\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Jim Suva of Citigroup.\\nJames Suva: Tim and Luca, you both mentioned earlier on the Q&A a little bit about India. I was wondering if we're now entering a situation of even more opportunity because we've exited COVID, we've exited countries with different COVID criteria. We've also seen India build out its higher speed transmissions. And your market is -- shares tremendously underrepresented there. And it appears with the supply chain, you're looking at diversifying kind of operational risk not specific to any country, but just overall. Now you look at potentially opening up stores and stuff. Am I right that, that's the way you look at it is it's even more prime for opportunity now than ever? And once you start opening up stores there, you could just see a complete green shoot of adoptions or any additional commentary on your view on India as now we've navigated COVID and supply chain and so many challenges over the past 2 years?\\nTimothy Cook: Yes. Jim, we actually did fairly well through COVID in India. And I'm even more bullish now on the other side of it, or hopefully, on the other side of it. And that's the reason why we're investing there. We're bringing retail there and bringing the online store there and putting a significant amount of energy there. I'm very bullish on India.\\nJames Suva: And then as my quick follow-up, you had mentioned that Services, not necessarily specific to India, but Services overall were better than expected. And of course, supply chain was more challenged than expected. So what was the bridge factor of Services being better than expected on upside? Was it like advertising or apps or paid monthly subscriptions? Or what were kind of the things that really surprised you to the upside on Services?\\nLuca Maestri: It was -- Jim, it's Luca. It's primarily the -- this level of engagement we saw, which then reflects into the, as you said, the paid subscriptions. We saw very good results in our cloud services business in payment services. Music was very strong. So we had a number of categories that set new records, all-time records. And they did a bit better than we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.  And so Tim mentioned that during, I think, his prepared remarks that when you look at it in constant currency, we grew services double digits. And that was on top of a 24% increase a year ago. So it's very sustained growth that we're seeing.\\nOperator: Our next question will come from Krish Sankar of Cowen and Company.\\nKrish Sankar: I have 2. The first one, Tim and Luca, you mentioned how the macro did soften, and it has an impact. And as consumers tighten their belt, when you look across your hardware products and service businesses, where are you seeing the biggest impact and where are you seeing the least impact from the softening macro? And then I had a quick follow-up.\\nTimothy Cook: We think there were some impact across the products and in Services. Probably, the ones that we saw the most impact on were Mac and Wearables. You can see that in those numbers. And probably, the least would have been iPhone.\\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Very helpful, Tim. And then just a quick follow-up on the Mac. The PC industry is expecting a decline in PC shipments this year also. How do you think about the Mac relative to kind of like where the PC industry as a whole is expecting the shipments to end up? Is there any color you can give on that?\\nTimothy Cook: The industry is very challenged, as you say. It's -- the industry is contracting. I think from us, though, is -- and I don't know how this year will play out, so I don't want to predict the year. But over the long run, we have a market that is a reasonable-sized market, a big market. And we have low share, and we have a competitive advantage with Apple silicon. And so strategically, I think we're well positioned in the market, albeit I think it will be a little rough in the short term.\\nTejas Gala: A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

We do appreciate your participation.\",\n          \"Operator: Welcome to Visa's Fiscal Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.\\nJennifer Como: Thanks, Jordan. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal third quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release. And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.\\nAl Kelly: Jennifer, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. Before I talk about the quarter, I wanted to acknowledge the passing of Dee Hock, Visa's Founder and Chief Executive Officer Emeritus. The whole Visa family deeply mourns the loss of a true visionary and a great man. Even with several global and macro events from the war in Ukraine to inflation, to concerns over a broader recession, Visa's business model has proven to be very resilient, with strong financial performance. Net revenues grew 19% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.98, up 33%. Total Q3 payment volume was 136% versus three years ago, up 1 point from Q2. In the U.S., payments volume index to 2019 was 146% in the quarter. U.S. debit volumes were 155% and credit 138% of 2019, both up modestly from Q2. Card-not-present, excluding travel volumes in the U.S., remained significantly ahead of prepandemic levels at 170% of 2019, consistent with Q2. International volume was 120% of 2019, down 1 point from Q2. Excluding China and Russia, it was 146% of 2019, up 6 points. Q3 Cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, were 123% versus three years ago, up 11 points from Q2, and this includes Russia in prior period numbers. Travel-related cross-border volumes rose 22 points from 82% of 2019 in Q2 to 104% in Q3, as we continue to see strong recovery in consumer and commercial travel. Process transactions were 139% versus 2019, 1 point above Q2. Credentials increased 8% year-over-year and are up 11%, excluding Russia. Before I dive into the client wins and progress towards our strategy, I wanted to take a moment to discuss two topics: recession and inflation. On the first, we're not economic forecasters, so I'm not going to predict the future or a potential likelihood of a recession. Instead, let's focus on the facts. From the numbers I just reviewed relative to 2019 levels, growth has been stable or improving in overall domestic payment volume, credit, debit, card present and card-not-present volume. And this indicates the most of 2022 with no indication of any slowdown, including in more recent weeks. In cross-border, of course, the recovery has continued to strengthen, while growth has been stable in aggregate, there are big shifts under the surface that continue to demonstrate the momentum of the recovery. First, from goods to services. Early in the pandemic, goods surpassed services. We were seeing the historic trend. Even as services have rebounded in the last six months, the percentage spending on goods in our payments volumes still remained high, higher than the pre-pandemic levels. For example, while U.S. home improvement and retail good spending during the third quarter grew only low single-digit year-over-year, it remains well ahead of pre-pandemic trendline. Second, many discussionary segments have further strengthened. If you look at U.S. travel spend, it is not backed to the pre-COVID trendline, but grew more than 40% versus last year. Third, the affluent spend continue to recover, particularly in the areas of restaurants, travel and entertainment. At the same time, non-affluent spend remained relatively resilient. We mentioned the affluent spend returning to restaurants last quarter. That trend continued this quarter with affluent restaurant spend indexing in the 160% to 180% range versus 2019. Similarly, in Europe in the last six months, luxury hotel payments volume and average ticket size outpaced growth in the overall hotel category versus 2019. At the same time, budget and mid-priced hotels saw modest improvements. Based on our numbers, we haven't seen any evidence of consumer pulling back spending in our markets. Now, a few words on inflation. It's just too early to draw any definitive conclusions. A few observations though on inflation. One, keep in mind that the headline CPI inflation number does not necessarily apply to Visa as our basket of goods isn't the same. Consumers just don't buy homes or use cards with their Visa cards, for example. So, we see a several point gap between headline inflation and inflation in card-related spend categories. Two, thus far, U.S. transaction growth relative to 2019 is strong and stable. Ticket sizes remain around 15 points above 2019 levels as they had for much of the pandemic due to several factors. Three, historically, in the U.S., we have seen PCE growth, which is the most important metric that drives our growth, remains strong even during inflationary periods. That said, lastly, excessive and long-term inflation is not good for consumers or the overall economy. Looking ahead, we'll continue to monitor the potential impact of inflation to ticket sizes, transaction counts, as well as volumes across spend categories. With all of that as backdrop, I'll now provide an update on progress with clients. Traditional issuers remain a key component of our consumer payments growth. And this quarter, we had several important partnership renewals globally. First, in China, we renewed our partnership with ICBC, the largest bank in the world, in terms of assets and the biggest credit card issuer in China in terms of the number of cards. In Japan, we renewed one of the country's largest credit issuers, Credit Saison, and expanded our issuing relationship with Toyota Finance. In Australia, we extended our credit and debit issuing agreements with NAV and CDA, two of the largest banks in the country. And in the U.S., we recently renewed our relationship with Green Dot, a top 20 issuer in debit and a top 10 issuer in prepaid. Fintechs are also key to our consumer payments growth. In Europe alone, we have more than 100 fintech programs that continue to deepen our relationship with these partners. Revolut is a great example. They already utilized a number of our capabilities, including Visa Direct and Currencycloud, and we just renewed our global issuing partnership. They also recently selected Tink for payment initiation services, which will allow users across Europe to seamlessly move money into their Revolut accounts. In many countries, the mobile operators are particularly important partners. We previously mentioned our partnerships with M-Pesa Africa and Safaricom, and I'm happy to report that we have begun issuance with these partners who are part of the Vodacom Group that cover 130 million customers in Sub-Saharan Africa. In a similar light, we also recently signed partnerships to issue Visa credentials, and in some cases, also enable Visa Direct with other mobile operators around the world. Mobily in Saudi Arabia with 10 million customers, Ooredoo in Qatar with around 2 million customers, Azercell in Azerbaijan with 5 million customers, and Orange Egypt with 27 million customers. I now want to dive a little deeper on two important markets, Brazil and India. Starting in Brazil, over the past two years, we have grown our business through issuing agreements with Ita\\u00fa, Mercado, Pago, Pataday and Caixa, with a 70% increase in credentials. In addition to traditional credit card issuance partners like Banco do Brasil have been growing their credit base by utilizing Visa's digital acquisition platform that allows them to instantly issue cards in a digital environment. Further, our fintech partners in Brazil, including Banco XP and Neon Pagamentos, have issued more than 20 million credentials over the past two years. On the acceptance side, we've doubled acceptance points since 2020, reaching more than 10 million merchant locations in Brazil. The results of our efforts over the past 8 to 10 quarters is evident in Brazil's payment volume, which in the third quarter was more than 200% of 2019, with e-commerce nearing 300%. In India, our efforts over the last few years are paying off and Q3 payments volume was 184% of 2019, with e-commerce above 300%. Building on that momentum, we had co-brand wins with two of the largest multibillion-dollar revenue Indian conglomerates that collectively represent millions of potential credentials. One with TataNeu, a super app for e-commerce financial services and loyalty programs across the Tata Group; two, with Aditya Birla Finance and SBI Cards, provide rewards for spending across all of their group companies. We also signed a co-brand with IndiGo, India's largest airline by number of passengers. And let me briefly touch on the US, where there's still great opportunity for cash digitization. We're excited about Tap to Pay, which has now reached 24% of face-to-face transactions in Q3. We're seeing positive trends in terms of additional spend and transaction lift in the US. In 2021, the average contactless active debit cardholder had two more transactions and $65 in additional spend each month. We expect this trend to continue, driving incremental payment volumes and transactions for contactless card issuers through faster, simpler POS experiences. Now moving to new flows, which in Q3 had over 20% revenue growth. In B2B, our Q3 commercial payments volume was 145% of 2019, up 6 points from Q2, driven by the return of travel. Q3 was the first quarter in which spend on business travel surpassed 2019 levels. This quarter, we're excited to have reached a significant multiyear agreement with WEX to enable their travel, health and corporate clients to make payments using Visa virtual card capabilities. WES is a global leader in financial technology solutions for commercial payments, and we are proud to partner with them. In the fleet space, we reached an agreement with M-PESA, a fintech based out of Kenya. Their fleet and expense management digital platform will address the problem of paying cash in the African trucking business through Visa prepaid reloadable credentials. Visa Direct is a powerful capability for many of our new flows. In this quarter, transactions grew 35%, excluding Russia.  On the remittance side, Western Union has enabled Visa Direct for their US customers to send money to select countries globally, expanding upon their initial rollout across Europe in 2021. We also expanded our agreement with Remitly, one of the world's premier digital service remittance companies to offer Visa Direct cross-border payments originating from Canada to bank accounts globally.  Another Visa Direct P2P expansion is with LINE Pay in Japan. Already a large wallet issuer, 6 million Visa credentials, LINE Pay is now enabling Visa Direct for cross-border and domestic use cases such as remittances and cash outs. On wage disbursement, GrubHub, a leading food ordering and delivery marketplace available in over 4,000 US cities, will enable drivers to quickly send their earnings to their eligible debit cards using Visa Direct. We are excited for them to join our other food delivery platforms, including DoorDash and SkipTheDishes. We also reached an agreement with the US tip enabler, TipSend [ph] to enable millions of tips disbursements to be pushed to employees' accounts through eligible debit cards at thousands of restaurant locations they serve. For TipSend, 90% of tips in the United States are still dispersed with cash today. In Canada, we reached an agreement with a large fintech, Wealthsimple, for accounts funds in and funds out for their over 2 million clients. Finally, enablers are key to our success in Visa Direct, and we recently signed a deal with Finastra, one of the world's largest financial services software companies and open banking platforms with 8,600 customers and serving 90 of the world's top 100 banks. Together, we will offer Finastra's clients access to cross-border business, the small business at B2C payouts to eligible accounts in multiple currencies and countries.  While the US was one of our first markets to achieve scale for Visa Direct, we have many other countries and regions that are growing and scaling. For example, in Latin America, third quarter transactions quadrupled versus last year. We have over 20 domestic and cross-border P2P programs commercially launched or in pilot, such as PLIN and Yape in Peru, WhatsApp in Brazil and Cash across Central America, in addition to many other programs for other use cases.  Now let me move to value-added services, which had Q3 revenue growth of almost 20%. Evaluated services grow through new and existing clients, existing services, expanding geographically and adding new services both organically and through acquisitions. Today, I'll provide an update on recent wins with some of our acquired entities. First, one of our earlier acquisitions, CyberSource, recently added NCR and Global Payments as partners, both intend to offer CyberSource capabilities to their merchant clients. This is an important strategy as our merchant base utilizing CyberSource through acquirers is growing payments volume twice as fast as the rest of our CyberSource business. Cardinal Commerce, our network-agnostic authentication capability, has grown transactions 30% globally year-to-date, with more than double that in Europe, where the secure customer authentication requirement has driven faster adoption of 3D Secure. VERIFI, our network agnostic dispute resolution solution, recently extended its agreement with PNC for VERIFI's cardholder dispute resolution network product. YellowPepper, the network agnostic connectivity platform, just signed Vex [ph], the Brazilian bank that offers its $50 million corporate and individual clients worldwide trade, e-commerce, staff solutions and most recently an FX API platform. Vex will use YellowPepper's payment initiation services to enable cross-border money movement starting with Visa Direct to send payouts to eligible cards. I mentioned Tink's recent win earlier. Our other acquisition from this fiscal year, Currencycloud, has signed more than 100 Fintech clients since December to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments. And finally, the tokenization capabilities we acquired now called Token ID have been selected by several partners. First, Global Payments will use Visa's Token ID as their strategic go-forward solution for multiple EMV network tokenization services to reduce card-not-present fraud and realize operational efficiencies for their clients. Second, the Clearinghouse, the first US real-time payment network in one of two US ACH networks, chose Visa's Token ID solution to power the secure token exchange. This industry-first account tokenization solution in the United States is utilizing Visa's Token ID payment account tokenization technology to replace sensitive customer account data with unique tokens and reduce the amount of exposed payment data. Our internally developed value-added services are just as important. One very compelling solution is from Visa consulting and analytics. Together with FIS, we recently launched a risk-as-a-service solution powered by data and risk experts. Key components of progress over the past 12 months include our real-time monitoring through our AI-enabled platform has blocked over $2 billion in fraudulent payments volume. Our analysis of potential fraud for a proactive testing identified a $15 million exposure to clients. Our capabilities to proactively detect and mitigate cyber criminals attempts to inject payment skimming malware onto online merchant checkout pages has prevented over $10 million in e-commerce-related losses. And our ability to detect terminal cloning has successfully blocked $3 million in fraud from attempted downloads. In sum, we had a very strong quarter and our results showed it. We made progress continuing to build relationships and solutions across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services that will fuel future growth around the globe. We remain vigilant in monitoring the trends in our business and the economy and confident on our strategy as we enable the movement of money globally. With that, let me turn it over to Vasant.\\nVasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon everyone. Our fiscal third quarter results reflected continued strength in domestic spend and a robust recovery in travel with net revenues up 19% and GAAP EPS up 36%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 33%. The ever strengthening dollar dragged down reported net revenue growth by almost three points and non-GAAP EPS growth by nearly three and a half points. In constant dollars, net revenue growth was over 21%, and non-GAAP EPS growth was 36%. Adjusting for Russia, constant dollar net revenue growth was 26%. A few key highlights. Global payments volume growth has remained strong and stable relative to pre-COVID levels. In constant dollars, the US index was 2 points higher than the second quarter, up 46% versus 2019. The international index, ex-China and Russia, was up 6 points from the second quarter, also 46% above 2019. The robust cross-border travel recovery continued. Index to 2019, cross-border travel volume, excluding transactions within Europe, jumped from 94 in March to 112 in June. This was helped by much of Asia opening up at the beginning of the quarter. The US inbound corridor picking up steam, as well as strong growth in and out of Europe, as we head into the peak summer travel season. Our three growth engines, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, all grew revenues around 20%. During the quarter, we bought back almost $2.5 billion in stock at an average price of $202.16. We also added $600 million to the MDL litigation escrow account. This had the same effect as a stock buyback at $200.25. We issued EUR 3 billion in debt, with maturities ranging from 4 to 12 years. We obtained attractive coupons on our inaugural eurobond issuance, ranging from 1.5% to 2.375%, well below rates achievable on the equivalent dollar-denominated debt. We have now prefunded debt maturities coming up in September and December. Finally, as a reminder, we suspended operations in Russia late in the second quarter. As such, there are no volumes, transactions or revenues from Russia in our third quarter numbers. Any comparisons to prior periods include Russia, unless otherwise noted. Now on to the details. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 36% above 2019. Excluding China and Russia, total payments volume growth was 17% and 46% higher than 2019. In the US, credit grew 21% and improved 3 points to 38% over 2019, helped by travel and fuel spend. Debit grew 4% year-over-year, lapping the big spike from the stimulus last year. Relative to 2019, debit was up 55%, sustaining significantly above the pre-COVID trend line even as credit has recovered. Debit has benefited from accelerated cash digitization through the pandemic. US card present spend grew 13% and was 27% above 2019, up 6 points. Card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 7% and was 70% higher than 2019. Relative to three years ago, e-commerce levels remain well above the pre-COVID trend line, even as card-present spend continues to recover. International constant dollar payments volumes, excluding China and Russia, grew 24% and was 46% above 2019. A few regional highlights. Latin America was up 40% year-over-year and 107% higher than 2019, with robust performance across the region fueled by cash digitization and client wins. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 34% year-over-year and 102% higher than 2019, led by client wins and cash digitalization. Europe was up 17% year-over-year and 37% higher than 2019, impacted by a portfolio conversion underway in the UK, ex-UK, Europe was 66% above 2019, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Excluding migrations, UK payment volumes have been stable in the third quarter, while Germany improved more than 15 points from the second quarter. Asia Pacific, excluding China, remains our weakest region but has improved significantly from the second quarter, up 24% year-over-year and 30% above 2019, up five points in the second quarter. Across Asia, most borders are open and domestic restrictions lifted. Only China remains mostly closed off, and Japan is gradually normalizing. Global process transactions were up 16% year-over-year and 39% over 2019 levels. Since we did not process domestic transactions in Russia, our reported process transactions are not materially impacted by the suspension of Russia operations. Now on to cross-border. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe were up 48% year-over-year and 23% over 2019. Cross-border card not present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 4% year-over-year and 62% above 2019. Cross-border travel related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 129% year-over-year and exceeded pre-COVID levels for the first time, indexing at 104 of 2019. The cross-border travel index went from the low 90s in March and April to 108% in May and 112% in June. We continue to see a rapid ramp-up in travel as soon as borders reopen or restrictions are lifted. A few highlights. Canada removed testing requirements for vaccinated travelers in April. Travel inbound to the US jumped 16 points in the third quarter to 86% of 2019 levels, helped by Canada, Europe and Asia. The lifting of testing requirements in June will hopefully help sustain the recovery of travel into the US. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean has been very strong through the COVID years, especially to Mexico. With more countries, including Costa Rica and Jamaica, lifting COVID protocols in April, inbound travel to the region climbed nearly 20 points in the third quarter to 50% of our 2019 levels. European Union member states removed previous testing and vaccination requirements for non-European citizens in April and May, resulting in travel to Europe recovering a sizable 30 points in the third quarter with more than half of that from North America. Inbound travel to Europe was 21% about 2019. Central Europe, Middle East, Africa, CEMEA region, outbound travel increased six points in the third quarter despite the loss of Russia, driven by Ukraine and travel for religious holidays from the Middle East and was 13% above 2019. In Asia, borders continue to open and travel restrictions eased for international travelers, resulting in inbound travel recovering 22 points in the third quarter to 58% of 2019 levels. Japan opened to tourists and increased the entry limit from 10,000 to 20,000 people per day. Australia dropped pre-arrival testing requirements in April. Several countries, including Malaysia and Vietnam, dropped testing requirements in May. The pace of travel recovery to and from Asia will be a key driver of the future trajectory of cross-border travel. Most Asian borders are now open, except for Mainland China and some restrictions in Taiwan and Japan. In the third quarter, travel into China indexed below 25% of 2019 and outbound from China below 40%. Moving now to a quick review of third quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 13%, slower than the 14% nominal growth in Q2 payments volume. Reported Q2 payments volumes include Russia, whereas revenues in Q3 do not since we recognized second quarter service revenues for Russia before we suspended operations last year -- last quarter. Data processing revenues grew 8%, below the 16% process transaction growth. Revenue growth lags transaction growth, primarily due to the suspension of Russia operations. As I mentioned earlier, Russia domestic transactions were not included in our reported process transactions, and as such, the loss of Russia does not materially impact transactions growth. However, we did have data processing revenue from Russia transactions in prior periods, which we do not anymore. This negatively impacted data processing revenue growth by over four points. There was also about a two-plus point exchange rate drag. International transaction revenues were up 51% versus the 38% increase in nominal cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility and select pricing actions. Other revenues grew 26%, led by consulting services and travel benefits. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines, each growing around 20%. Consumer payments growth was led by the recovery in cross-border volumes, high currency volatility and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows growth was driven by carded B2B recovery. Commercial or B2B volumes grew 27% year-over-year and are up 45% versus 2019. Growth was driven, in part, by increased travel and was broad-based globally across small and large businesses. Excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 35% due to strong growth outside the US. Value-added services growth was led by consulting services as well as risk and identity solutions. Revenue growth drivers include higher volumes from existing clients, greater clients and attrition and select pricing actions. Client incentives were 26.1% of gross revenues below our expectations. This was primarily driven by the faster-than-expected recovery of higher-yielding cross-border volumes, which improved revenue mix. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth. Exchange rates were an approximately 3-point drag on reported revenue growth. The suspension of Russia operations reduced revenues by approximately 5 points. GAAP operating expenses grew 51%, inclusive of a $716 million provision associated with the interchange multi-restrict litigation. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 15%. The inclusion of Currencycloud and Tink added about 3 points. The suspension of Russia operations reduced expenses by about 3 points. Exchange rates were about a 2-point benefit. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $246 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP non-operating expense was $73 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 13.3%. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates benefited by 6 points from the resolution of certain US state and foreign tax matters related primarily through prior years.  Our recurring tax rate remains in the 19% to 19. 5% range. GAAP EPS was $1.60. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.98, up 33% over last year, inclusive of nearly 3.5 point drag from the stronger dollar. With a quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share and our stock buybacks, we returned $3.3 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Through the first three weeks of July, business trends have remained strong and stable.  On a year-over-year basis, US payments volume was up 12% with debit up 6% and credit up 18%. US spend growth versus 2019 was up 46% with debit up 55% and credit up 38%. These trends are consistent with the third quarter and with performance in major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 14% year-over-year, up 40% versus 2019. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 60% year-over-year and 29% over 2019. Card-not-present nontravel growth was 57% above 2019. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 16% above 2019. Moving now to our outlook for the fourth quarter. As Al indicated, we're seeing no evidence of a pullback in consumer spending. US payments volumes have indexed in the mid-140 range versus 2019 since January through July 21. Excluding Russia and China, international payments volumes have also indexed about 140 since January. Process transactions have been stable at around 140 versus 2019. As such, we are assuming that the trends we have seen in payments volume and processed transactions will continue through the fourth quarter. We will, of course, stay vigilant and on the lookout for any changes caused by rising interest rates, high inflation and declining consumer confidence. Through July, the cross-border recovery has progressed faster and further than we had expected last October. For the fourth quarter, we're assuming stable growth versus 2019 in cross-border e-commerce and some improvement from travel in and out of Europe and into the US, especially from Asia. The next and perhaps the last leg of the cross-border travel recovery will have to await a full reopening in China, which we do not expect in the near future.  With these assumptions, fourth quarter net revenues could grow at the high teens to 20% range in constant dollars. This includes Tink and Currencycloud, which add approximately 0.5 point to net revenues, and the suspension of operations in Russia, which subtracts approximately 5 points.  The dollar has continued to strengthen, significantly increasing the exchange rate drag, which we expect will reduce reported net revenue growth by 4 to 5 points. Q4 client incentives are expected to range between 26% and 27% of gross revenues, driven primarily by anticipated strong volume performance across all regions. For the year, we now expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the middle of the 25.5% to 26.5% range. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in constant dollars to grow at the low end or high teens. This includes 2 points of added expense from Currencycloud and Tink, offset by 3 points from reduced costs due to Russia. Personnel costs will be higher since we are granting annual salary increases a quarter earlier than normal to all employees below the SVP level. This will add three points to Q4 operating expense growth. Exchange rates could reduce reported operating expense growth by about two points. Our tax rate is expected to stay in the 19% to 19.5% range. While there's uncertainty, consumer spending remains strong. Growth has been stable across payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transactions globally. We have demonstrated our ability to adjust to different environments and are prepared to do so again if warranted. We will stay vigilant, flexible and agile. We are fortunate to have a resilient business with great momentum and extraordinary longer term growth opportunities. With that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer.\\nJennifer Como: Thanks Vasant. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Jordan.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. I know we're indexing well below where we normally would be if the pandemic didn't occur for cross-border travel. However, I guess there's a fear that we're seeing the strength partly because it's pent-up demand and then inflation. Could you help us think about how you feel about the risks associated with the drop-off in cross-border? And then Vasant, you talked about Asia being the key. How much more strength can we see out of the non-China region? Thanks.\\nAl Kelly: So, I'll start, Sanjay. I actually think cross-border travel has come back very, very strongly and quicker than what we thought and that still with as you suggested, Asia being quite low. You heard the numbers, both inbound and outbound, in Vasant's remarks. Plus inbound to the U.S., somewhat up until recently because of the COVID -- required COVID test and now the strength of the U.S. dollar still has upside as well. So, yes, for sure, there is some element of pent-up demand, but I think that, that demand is going to remain strong for some time. And I don't see people being deterred even by higher cost of airline tickets that people are experiencing. If anything, probably the experiential element of waiting in airports for a longer period of time because of understaffing that exists in a number of places around the world is probably the thing that weighs more on my mind, but I expect that to normalize at some point here soon. Vasant, do you want to add anything?\\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Clearly, I mean, there's a variety of factors at play here. First, there has been a general shift in consumer preferences. You've heard this from other people, to move away from goods to experiences, and travel is very much a beneficiary of that. It's not just cross-border travel. As Al said in his remarks, it's all travel, including domestic travel. So, it's a pretty broad-based desire to travel. The second is people are keen to travel. So, as soon as restrictions are lifted, you see the reactions right away. In terms of where the strength is, clearly, the recovery in Asia has been quite strong. You saw how much it improved this quarter, almost 20 points, if I remember right. And it is continuing. It's happening all across Asia, except for places like China, and they're still -- it's not that easy to get in and out of Japan and Taiwan. But elsewhere, it's very strong across Asia. There's a huge amount of interest in traveling to Europe and significant interest in European traveling out of Europe. So Europe has been also recovering very fast and is indexing at pretty high levels relative to pre-COVID volumes. The other area that continues to surprise is Latin America. We told you that it was always quite high, because Latin America stayed fairly open. But in the last quarter it jumped another 20 points and is indexing in the 150 range for people traveling into Latin America. So as you look across it, this looks pretty durable. There's still recovery left to come, as you can see. Asia still was indexing well below 2019 levels. The U.S. is still below 2019 levels. So we don\\u2019t think this ends anytime soon.\\nJennifer Como: Great. Next question, Jordan?\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\\nLisa Ellis: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Al, you had a number of callouts in the prepared remarks related to Visa Direct. I was hoping to get your perspective on the news that the CFPB is investigating the levels of fraud in Zelle and other domestic P2P services. Can you just comment a bit or give us a little bit of color on how the fraud protections associated with Visa Direct are different or similar to those services and sort of how that type of investigation might impact Visa Direct's role in P2P over the long-term? Thank you.\\nAl Kelly: Well, thanks, Lisa. One of the terrific things about Visa Direct is that, it isn't running on a different new platform. It runs on VisaNet and, therefore, has the ability to utilize all of the same capabilities that we have on VisaNet, including those related to KYC and those related to fraud prevention. So, certainly, this is something that we're well aware of and we'll continue to watch closely. I do think that consumers value this P2P capability in very, very big ways, not just in the United States, but around the world, and I certainly expect it to be a use case that continues to grow around the world, and we'll just have to make sure that we're working closely with Zelle and other partners to make sure that we're contributing as much as we can to make sure that, that service is secure as can be, because as you know, trust is a basic underpinning of money movement in every single use case around the world.\\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan?\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\\nDarrin Peller: Hey, guys. Thanks. I really want to touch on your willingness and ability to manage expenses and margins going forward in different outcomes, different scenarios. You pulled forward, it looks like salary increases. So does that pull forward some of the OpEx growth we normally see in fiscal 2023? And then just thinking through, if we were to see downturns economically, what kind of willingness and an ability do you have to really manage margins going forward?\\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. The pull forward of salary increases means that when we get to the fourth quarter of next year, we'll lap the increase that we have. So in that sense, yes, it moderates a little bit the impact on next year since some of it comes into this year. You've seen us in the past adjust based on external circumstances, and we will be monitoring trends and will stay flexible and move fast if we have to, again. That said, this is a business with tremendous long-term growth opportunities. We think the new use cases that are being developed in the new flows business and the opportunities we have across value-added services for global expansion, for deeper penetration of existing clients as well as adding new services are very significant. So we have to be keeping an eye on the long-term opportunity and not under-investing. Having said that, if times get tough, we -- as we did during the pandemic, you prioritize, you sequence things, you pace things. You don't pull back on all the investment. You just try to do it based on a new reality. So during the pandemic, for example, we scale back in certain areas like cross-border where spending on marketing or things like that wouldn't have made any difference because borders were closed. And we'll try and do things like that if we have to again.\\nJennifer Como: Next question.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi, thanks so much. Great results. Very clear. The consumer is strong here. And I know, Al, you said you don't want to predict the macro, but I figured I'd ask if you can comment here on how resilient Visa might be now versus past recessions, because on the one hand, I'm thinking of this product credentials, acceptance, contactless or that would suggest more resilience. But on the other side, you have more value-added services revenue that might be more cyclical. So I know aside from shocks like the financial crisis and pandemic, your growth premium to PC has been clear. But what about now? Do you feel differently? Any new thinking on how Visa might be different versus past recessions? Thanks.\\nAl Kelly: Well, thanks, Tien-Tsin. I think we're a very different company from any past recession, I guess, going back to 2008-2009 time frame. First of all, we're strong -- much stronger in debit, which tends to be the vehicle, the card of choice for people in a slowdown period. We're stronger in everyday spend categories. We're stronger in e-commerce. We benefited from this acceleration in cash utilization that happened during the pandemic. Since the last recession, we've added Europe, which is a very important part of the company today and contributes to our growth. And then as you alluded to, we've added an emphasis on value-added services and new flows. Some of those value-added services are tied to volume. So the degree that some volumes might go down, those might go down as well. But on the other hand, for volumes that we will have today that we -- that will have the opportunity to sell more value-added services than we would have in the prior recession. The last thing I would say is that it is very possible that today, people are changing what they're buying, but they're not changing how they're paying. And we fall into the latter category. And we see overall spending levels, as we talked about remaining high, and we continue to see people choosing to pay with Visa not depending on any change that they might be making in what they're buying or the baskets that they have.\\nJennifer Como: Next question?\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.\\nHarshita Rawat: Hi, good afternoon. So Al, I want to follow up on your comments on the banking. So now that you closed the Tink acquisition earlier this year, can you elaborate on your efforts in open banking and what role can just play? And just taking a step back, how excited are you about the opportunity that in open banking for Visa? Thanks.\\nAl Kelly: Well, I think open banking is in its early days, but I think that we're quite well positioned. As you well know, that the ground zero for open banking happens to be Europe. We have a very good business there. And obviously, Tink has a footprint in 18 markets in Europe. It has a single API that allows customers, primarily developers that access financial data. It has connectivity to 3,400 banks and financial institutions and greater than 10,000 developers. And we believe the thesis for us is that takes capabilities with our capabilities and our relationships will allow Tink to be stronger where it already is, and will -- with our help, we'll be able to broaden their footprint in which Tink operates. And that's certainly one of the things that we're in discussions internally with Tink, as to where we go next in the world. We also think that our infrastructure and our cyber and fraud capabilities and our capabilities related to protecting the customers' transaction at all the steps along the way is going to just help accelerate the adoption of open banking in Europe. So we're excited about the prospects of it. We think we're really well positioned. It's just going to be a matter of how quickly it takes off, but we're in good shape to the degree that it does.\\nJennifer Como: Next question?\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. I wanted to ask about the three key drivers, all growing over 20% in consumer payments, the new flows and value-added services. As we think about going forward and how this is likely to normalize some, I assume consumer payments growth will slow as cross-border eventually lap some tougher comps. But maybe new flows and value-added services still has some extra juice for growth. Just hoping maybe you could parse through some of the pluses and minuses for the three segments.\\nAl Kelly: Well, Bryan, that's been the thesis from the beginning that we want to make sure that we generate on a sustained ongoing basis attractive revenue growth. And you're certainly correct that at some point in time, depending upon the pace at which Asia cross-border comes back and US inbound cross-border continues to come back, that will settle back into some more normal level growth rate for consumer payments. I'm not going to predict when that will be, whether that's in two quarters or six quarters or seven quarters, but it will happen at some point in time. And our expectation and aspiration has been that value-added services and new flows will grow at numbers of percentage points higher than consumer payments that will, therefore, allow us to get to sustained revenue growth rate that we think, over time, will be attractive to the investors in the company.\\nJennifer Como: Next question.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\\nDon Fandetti: I just want to confirm, so just given all the weakness of some of the retailers, you're not seeing any signs on the low-end consumer weakness. And then does your data historically show any correlation around a wealth effect for the more affluent US consumers at Visa?\\nAl Kelly: Don, you're touching on -- there's a number of elements that impact our volumes. And we'll touch on a few of them. Affluent spenders are returning to the economy and their higher spending in restaurants and travel, among other categories. And this isn't necessarily inflation, but a mix shift. The impact of people working from home and hybrid work definitely continue to have impact on smaller tickets that are things that people buy in the mornings and at lunch time, when they're actually commuting and working in an office environment.  Certainly, small tickets, as a percentage of overall tickets, are still below pre-pandemic levels as a result. Last year, stimulus clearly drove ticket sizes up, particularly in discretionary categories, and we're kind of lapping that now. What we don't know are what level of substitutions are taking place, where people might be buying more staples and less discretionary items, but they're spending at the same level they did, or whether as some retailers have said, people are trading down from brands to private labels. But it's also difficult for us to understand consumption reduction. So, for example, consumers could be buying less fuel, but spending at the same amount or buying smaller package sizes of things like snacks and yet spending the same amount. So, I think, Don, clearly, inflation is in our numbers. And people are likely to change, making some changes on what they're buying. But as I said earlier, I think in response to Tien-Tsin's question, they're not changing how they're paying.\\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. I mean going back to your question on whether we're seeing any slowdown in spending by lower income consumers. No, we're not. We keep looking for it because we've heard some other people say it, and we're not seeing any evidence of that. Your second question, I presume was the wealth effect on affluent consumers of what's happening in the stock market and things like that?  As Al said, I mean we're not seeing that. If anything, affluent spending has been on the rise and is one of the reasons why we've seen some of the robust growth we saw this quarter. Remember, we're lapping a very significant growth quarter last year that included sizable stimulus payments. And despite that, we had some very good growth this quarter. And a lot of that is driven by affluent consumers, by discretionary spending coming back and no evidence of a wealth effect that people are holding back.\\nJennifer Como: Next question, Jordan.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good afternoon. You've clearly been continuing to be very aggressive on share repurchase. But could you update us on your capital allocation priorities in this particular environment? We've seen obviously a pretty big pullback in valuations and payments. How is your acquisition appetite and pipeline changed today versus, let's say, a year ago?\\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. Capital allocation has -- approach has not changed. As we've said before, our first priority is investing in our core business. We generate a lot of free cash flow. Our first priority is to invest in what is a fabulous business we have, which has tremendous growth opportunities as we've discussed around some of the new use cases and new flows around value-added services and of course, in our core consumer payments business. After that, clearly, it's how can M&A enhance what we do, and we can do that by buying something that expands our capabilities like we've done in the past, or something that gives us new capabilities like Tink does with open banking or like Currencycloud does with the capabilities they have that are geared towards real-time FX and serving the needs of newer enterprises, the Fintechs rather than traditional companies. So, we will continue to look for things that can enhance what we have. In terms of timing and opportunities, clearly, as valuations have come back in, we've stayed disciplined when things are bubbly. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have tremendous capacity. We are definitely interested in acquisitions where the value is justified. Time will tell where the valuations in private markets get to levels that are attractive and companies have to be for sale. But clearly, M&A is an important component of our future. We have clear ideas on where we want to expand M&A-wise. And as they come up, we'll talk about it.\\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rayna Kumar with UBS. Your line is open.\\nRayna Kumar: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In your remarks, you mentioned pricing actions helped your cross-border revenue. As you look across the breadth of your products and services, do you think there's still more opportunity to improve pricing in certain areas?\\nAl Kelly: Yes. Something that we will watch and be very thoughtful about over time. But we have -- we've got years and years of experience in pricing in the consumer payments business and we're building our sophistication in terms of pricing in our newer lines of business in new flows and value-added services. As we said many times, our philosophy is that we want to make sure that we're pricing in a way that balances all the various parties within the ecosystem and ideally stimulates more and more cash digitization and more and more money movement across our network. So, in short, we think there definitely is still more opportunity in the pricing lever.\\nJennifer Como: Next question Jordan.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open.\\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hey Al, hi Vasant. Great quarter here. It's pretty clear based on your results and comments that the consumer seems unaffected so far. My question was, are you seeing an impact in your conversations with enterprises, so basically banks, merchants and fintechs, given what's going on in terms of either the pace of decision-making or the types of products or services that they're seeking out now? If you could comment on that.\\nAl Kelly: I have not heard that from any clients or partners that I have talked to. Look, I think everybody is out there wondering whether we're going to or not going to face a recession. We're certainly undeniably in a high inflation environment right now. But given that, that was really driven by a shortage of workers leading to a shortage of production of goods and services and then, you throw the Ukrainian war on top of it, which had some impacts along the way, and all of this coming off of a pandemic, there really isn't a history that provides any kind of insight into exactly what might happen here. We're continuing to do two things. One is to make sure that we're smartly investing in the future to drive our three growth levers. And as Vasant alluded to in response to a question earlier, we're being very vigilant in looking into the numbers and seeing if we see anything that requires us to be proactive in any action that we might take. But at this point, as I think we've said a few times now, the level of consumer spending up through July 21, which reported on in Vasant's remarks, have the consumer spending has remained very resilient. And for how long that will be, one, it remains to be seen. But again, I'd remind everybody that we don't have the same input costs and COGS as other businesses. And we're a company that facilitates payments. So regardless of whether people are consuming differently or substituting one good for another good, they still need to pay for it and they're utilizing our services to do that.\\nJennifer Como: Next question?\\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. Thanks for all the color and commentary, Al and Vasant. Obviously, you can track quite well how the consumer is tracking now across all the different metrics, as we've talked a lot about. When you look at forward, can you talk a little bit about what you look at as potential indicators? And I guess, especially since as Sanjay started off the questions around travel, what are you seeing in things around forward bookings and any changes or indications there or elsewhere? Thank you.\\nVasant Prabhu: Yes. As Al said, I mean, we don't view ourselves as economic forecasters and don't want to get into that. And we've said before that we are not leading indicators. We probably coincident indicators. If there's a change in spending, we'll see it as it happens. The only area of our business where we see a little bit ahead is, as you said, in travel bookings, and those are holding up well. Whether it's cross-border bookings or domestic travel bookings, if you look at the card-not-present element of travel which is where those bookings happen; there is really no change in trend. So at least looking out 30, 60 days, which is what the lead time is on those kinds of things, there is no change in trend. Other than that, a lot of what we see is quite intuitive. There's -- as Al said, there's a shift towards discretionary purchases. There's a shift towards things people couldn't do before, during the pandemic, experiences around restaurants, entertainment and travel. As we said, while goods may not be growing as much as they were year-over-year, they're still well above the COVID -- pre-COVID trend line. So there's nothing there that is out of the ordinary at this point.\\nJennifer Como: Last question Jordan.\\nOperator: Our last question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks guys. I just wanted to come back to cross-border travel. Now that you were at, I think, 116% of 2019 levels in July, I know your prior target was to be at 100% by the end of the fiscal year. So what would be your new target there? And then can you just comment on inbound versus outbound US, kind of where that's tracking versus 2019 levels and your thoughts going forward there just given the strength of the dollar? Thank you.\\nVasant Prabhu: Yeah. I mean outbound from the US is very strong. It's been about 2019 levels now for a few, if not weeks, a couple of months. Inbound to the US, we told you was indexing in the high 80s. So it's still below 2019 levels. And we think that there's room for recovery there. What we've seen on the cross-border side is a little bit of a stair step where you have periods where there's rapid growth like you saw in April and May and we saw in October and November, when a variety of countries remove restrictions, you see a huge amount of travel happening fairly quickly. And then you see a certain amount of stabilization after that, like we saw partly because of Omicron in December and January, and we saw in March and April. As you look at the fourth quarter, most of the world is open. And so we are assuming steady improvement in travel out of Asia, steady improvement of travel into and out of Europe, improvement of travel into the US. But there are no big openings left, which is why we don't think there'll be a big stair step up in the fourth quarter. We'll wait and see. The big openings left would be China, of course, which we gave you the index. It's still very low. And there's recovery left in Japan, because letting in 20, 000 people is one-fifth of what the normal amount of people who go into Japan were. It's more like 100,000 people. So there's a few left. So the short answer is a modest recovery in the fourth quarter, and we'll see what happens.\\nJennifer Como: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day.\\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.\",\n          \"Operator: Good morning. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn -- introduce the call to Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may proceed.\\nLiz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, Vice Chairman and President; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President and President, Allergan Aesthetics; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call are Scott Reents, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Roopal Thakkar, Vice President, Global Regulatory Affairs. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.\\nRick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll provide perspective on our overall performance and outlook and then Jeff, Carrie, Tom and Rob, who will review our business highlights pipeline progress financial results and 2023 guidance in more detail. Today, we reported another strong quarter and a highly productive year for AbbVie. We delivered full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $13.77 reflecting double-digit growth. Total net revenues of more than $58 billion were up by 5.1% on an operational basis, driven by impressive growth from SKYRIZI and RINVOQ which generated nearly $7.7 billion of combined sales in 2022. As I reflect on our 10 years as an independent company, we have made excellent progress evolving AbbVie into a leading biopharmaceutical company. We have successfully created a well-diversified portfolio with multiple growth platforms in attractive and sustainable markets. This includes the rapid development and launch of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ across all of HUMIRA's major indications, plus a distinct new indication, atopic dermatitis. We anticipate these 2 products will collectively exceed the peak revenues achieved by HUMIRA by 2027 with significant growth expected through the end of the decade. We are also building a substantial portfolio of novel, heme and solid tumor assays for oncology. The anticipated launches and indication ramp of several new products like venetoclax in multiple myeloma and MDS, epacritumab across B-cell malignancies and Teliso-V, a new treatment option in non-small cell lung cancer will collectively support growth in the middle of the decade. We expect continued robust performance in neuroscience with our leading on-market portfolio to address migraine and psychiatric conditions as well as a promising pipeline for neurodegenerative diseases. And we see significant long-term growth potential for aesthetics, an extremely attractive market which is underpenetrated, where we have the leading position in toxins with BOTOX cosmetic and Fillers Rejuvido [ph]. Second, we've established a productive innovation-driven R&D organization with a robust pipeline. Our R&D engine has discovered and developed Five major billion-plus medicines over the past decade. We are committed to pursuing new ways to address patients' most serious health issues and have more than doubled our annual R&D investment since our inception. The breadth and the depth of our pipeline which now includes more than 80 programs across all development stages, further supports our long-term growth outlook. Lastly, we have maintained a strong financial position. to fully invest in innovative science and commercial initiatives across our therapeutic categories to drive long-term growth. We've also used that financial position to support a robust and growing dividend which we have increased by 270% since our inception. And we have also used it as capacity to pursue value-enhancing business development to augment our existing portfolio and pipeline. With these strong operating characteristics, we remain well positioned to absorb the impact of the HUMIRA LLE and quickly return to robust sales growth in 2025. As it pertains to AbbVie's near-term outlook, we anticipate 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $10.70 to $11.10. This guidance range contemplates, we expected headwind from direct biosimilar competition with U.S. HUMIRA sales down approximately 37% which is at the lower end of our previous erosion projection of 35% to 55%. Robust performance from SKYRIZI and RINVOQ which we expect will collectively generate $11.1 billion of revenue, reflecting year-over-year growth of nearly 45%. Revenue pressure in [indiscernible] with recent challenging market and share dynamics impacting IMBLUVICA, partially offset by strong sales growth of venetoclax. Double-digit revenue growth of neuroscience including accelerating sales of Vraylar with our recent MDD approval. Our guidance also contemplates the transient economic impact primarily in the U.S. on aesthetic procedure growth, affecting near-term performance for toxins, fillers and body contouring. Given that it's difficult to predict the duration of economic and inflationary pressures, we have not assumed the recovery in 2023. And finally, this guidance reflects increasing investments in both R&D and SG&A to support our long-term growth opportunities. It's also important to note that while it is possible 2023 could outperform our guidance, depending upon the shape of the HUMIRA erosion curve. We don't anticipate that 2024 earnings will be lower than the $10.70 for of the 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance which we are issuing today. In summary, we are executing well across our business and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?\\nJeff Stewart: Thank you, Rick. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology which delivered total revenues of more than $7.9 billion, up 19.5% on an operational basis. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are performing exceptionally well, contributing more than $2.3 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting operational growth of 70%. SKYRIZI continues to exceed our expectations, outperforming our initial full year guidance by more than $750 million. Global revenues this quarter were nearly $1.6 billion, up 12.8% on a sequential basis. SKYRIZI is achieving strong market share momentum globally with in-play psoriatic disease leadership in 24 countries and total market share leadership in more than a dozen key markets. In psoriasis, SKYRIZI's total prescription share of the U.S. biologic psoriasis market has increased to more than 28%. And there is substantial room for continued growth in psoriasis based on SKYRIZI's leading in-play share of new and switching patients which remains at nearly 50%. Psoriatic arthritis is also providing a nice inflection to SKYRIZI sales, especially in the U.S. Dermatology segment, where we have achieved approximately 10% share of the total biologic market. And we are also seeing encouraging SKYRIZI new patient starts in the U.S. room segment as well which accounts for more than 80% of all PSA treatments. SKYRIZI is being co-positioned with RINVO to rheumatologists where these 2 products combined have already achieved a leading in-play PSA room share of approximately 16%. In Crohn's disease, we are making excellent progress with the U.S. launch. Feedback from gastroenterologists has been very positive, especially as it relates to SKYRIZI's novel dosing and overall clinical profile. We recently started DTC promotion for this indication and are already achieving a total in-play patient share of more than 15%. Turning now to invoke which delivered global sales of $770 million, representing double-digit sequential growth. In rheumatology, global prescriptions are ramping nicely across RINVOQ's 4 approved indications, RA, PSA, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA. We continue to see positive market share momentum in both the U.S. and across key international geographies. In atopic dermatitis, RINVOQ is demonstrating strong uptake in both treatment naive and second-line patients globally. Feedback from the global derm community supports the importance of RINVOQ as a long-term chronic therapy to control atopic dermatitis, especially as it relates to skin clearance and rapid itch relief. RINVOQ AD prescriptions are trending up globally with 20% to 35% in-place shares across our major international markets and a mid-teens in-place share in the U.S. which are both tracking in line with our expectations. In gastroenterology, the launch trends for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis are very strong. Physicians have been pleased with RINVOQ's high rates of endoscopic healing as well as the speed of onset which has quickly resulted in RINVOQ achieving approximately 20% in-play share in the U.S. second line plus setting. Internationally, RINVOQ UC is now approved in 50 countries with reimbursement discussions progressing in line with our expectations. This strong adoption in UC amongst gastroenterologists is very encouraging for RINVOQ's potential in Crohn's disease as well. We are on track for U.S. and EMA regulatory decisions in the second quarter and are preparing for the commercial launch. Global HUMIRA sales were approximately $5.6 billion, up 6% on an operational basis with 9.9% growth in the U.S. partially offset by international, where revenues were down 16.9% operationally due to biosimilar competition. In the U.S., we have secured broad formulary access for HUMIRA encompassing more than 90% of all covered lives which enables us to compete for patient volume at parity to biosimilars. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.6 billion, down 11.2% on an operational basis. Imbruvica [ph] global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 19.5%. The U.S. performance continues to be impacted by challenging market and share dynamics attributed to the pace of COVID recovery as well as increasing competition. Venclexta global sales were $56 million, up 12.2% on an operational basis, with continued strong demand in both AML and CLL. We are particularly pleased with the international performance driven by robust share gains in the EU and across Asia. In neuroscience, revenues were $1.7 billion, up 5.1% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to demonstrate robust growth. Sales of $565 million were up 15.5% on an operational basis, reflecting increasing market share, primarily in bipolar 1 disorder. Vraylar was also recently approved as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder, marking its fourth approved indication and adding a new substantial opportunity for long-term growth. We are very pleased with the AMDD label which confirms Vraylar's strong benefit risk profile, dosing flexibility with positive efficacy results for both the 1.5 and 3-milligram dose and the ability to reduce depressive symptoms as an add-on for the partial responders who present and this is important, with or without symptoms of anxiety. The AMDD launch is off to a strong start and we are already seeing a nice inflection in total new prescriptions in the marketplace. Within migraine, our leading oral CGRP portfolio contributed $249 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of nearly 30% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and QULIPTA. We are also pursuing in the U.S. commercial approval for QULIPTA as a preventative treatment for patients with chronic migraine which would further strengthen our competitive profile and uniquely position QULIPTA as the only oral CGRP available as a preventative treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine. Rounding out the migraine portfolio is BOTOX Therapeutic, a unique treatment with a dozen approved therapeutic indications and the clear branded leader in chronic migraine prevention. Total BOTOX Therapeutic sales were $728 million, up 10.7% on an operational basis. And last, we continue to prepare for the launch of ABBV-951 in both the U.S., Europe and Japan later this year. 951 represents a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease and a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. So overall, I'm pleased with the performance and the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\\nCarrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. Full year 2022, global aesthetic sales were approximately $5.3 billion, reflecting growth of 5% on an operational basis. Global Botox cosmetic sales were approximately $2.6 billion, up nearly 21% operationally and global Juvederm sales were approximately $1.4 billion, down roughly 2% operationally. Our global aesthetics portfolio grew in 2022 despite several headwinds, most notably inflationary dynamics in the U.S., COVID-related lockdowns in China and suspension of our operations in Russia. In the U.S. we began to see a slowdown in aesthetic procedures in the second quarter of last year which coincided with the softening in economic metrics. These trends continued through the end of the year with the most significant impact on higher priced more deferrable procedures, including fillers and body contouring. Despite these economic pressures, U.S. Botox cosmetic sales grew approximately 16% in 2022, driven by strong first half sales with growth moderating over the remainder of the year. Similarly, U.S. Juvederm saw strong growth in the first quarter of the year but filler market declines throughout the second half of the year resulted in full year sales being down approximately 17% versus a robust 2021. We continue to track a number of key external economic metrics, including real personal consumption and the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index. While we have not seen major improvements in these metrics, data over the course of the last several months has shown stabilization. It remains difficult to predict the duration of these economic headwinds. But as Rick noted, we have modeled them to persist through the end of 2023. Our international aesthetics portfolio continued to demonstrate robust growth with the strong performance in most major markets, offsetting impacts from China and Russia. International Botox cosmetic sales of nearly $1 billion were up approximately 29% operationally and international Juvederm sales grew approximately 9% on an operational basis. We delivered this performance despite the significant headwinds we faced last year in our 2 largest international filler market, China and Russia. While our aesthetics portfolio in China continues to be impacted by COVID-related headwinds -- the current wave appears to have peaked. We expect the situation to improve through the first half of 2023 with full recovery in China beginning in the third quarter. Despite the transitory challenges we're facing, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our aesthetics portfolio. Consumers continue to be very interested in the aesthetics category and in our brands. We see substantial room for further market penetration across each of our aesthetics categories and are continuing to invest to support long-term growth. Our promotional efforts are focused on driving more consumers into our customers' offices while increasing retention and productivity of existing patients. We have built a best-in-class commercial technology team known for developing our consumer loyalty program, Eli. We have over 5 million consumers who use Eli and more than 20,000 of our customers' offices. We have a series of new technology products launching this year to drive growth in the aesthetics market and support our customers and consumers. Internationally, we are focused on markets with significant growth potential. We have increased investments in injector training and expanded our field force in China which is our second largest market. Latin America which is very aesthetically oriented and Japan which is growing rapidly and is expected to be one of our fastest-growing markets in 2023. Additionally, we are focused on delivering new product innovation. This year, we're launching 2 new fillers in the U.S., VOLUX for improvement of jawline which was approved late last year and Skin Vive for enhanced skin quality attributes, including hydration which is expected to be approved in the first half of 2023. We're also continuing to launch Harmonica, our hybrid bio-stimulatory HA filler in several international markets. The investments we're making to support long-term growth for our aesthetics portfolio, along with the stabilizing economic outlook and improving tobidynamics in China, leave us well positioned for future growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\\nTom Hudson: Thank you, Carrie. We expect significant program advancement across all stages of our pipeline this year. In immunology, we continue to make very good progress with programs in our core diseases as well as in adjacent areas of rheumatology and dermatology, where we are expanding our portfolio. We're nearing completion of SKYRIZI's registrational program in ulcerative colitis which is the last major indication expansion program for SKYRIZI. In the first half of this year, we'll see data from the Phase III induction and maintenance studies for SKYRIZI in ulcerative colitis with our regulatory submissions anticipated later this year. We'll also see data this year from our head-to-head comparison studies evaluating SKYRIZI versus other commonly used agents which we expect will further distinguish its profile from competitive offerings. These studies include our Phase III trial in Crohn's disease versus STELARA and our Phase III trial in psoriasis versus Otezla. Results from these studies will add to the body of evidence supporting SKARIZI as a best-in-category agent in these indications. We're also nearing completion of the core indication expansion programs for RINVOQ. Our regulatory applications for RINVOQ and Crohn's disease are under review and we anticipate approval decisions in the second quarter. RINVOQ demonstrated very strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement in our Phase III induction and maintenance studies and we believe RINVOQ will be an important new treatment option once approved in Crohn's disease. This is a market where approximately 80% of bioexperience patients have used the TNF inhibitor and there remains considerable unmet need for therapies that can deliver high rates of response and long-term remission. Beyond our core immunology indications, we're developing RINVOQ in several diseases where we've seen strong evidence that our JAK inhibitor has the potential to become a highly effective therapy. Our Phase III program is already underway in 1 of these indications, giant cell arteritis. And later this year, we plan to begin Phase III studies for 4 additional diseases, systemic lupus, hidradenitis suppurativa, vitiligo and alopecia areata. Moving now to our oncology portfolio, where we expect several important regulatory and clinical milestones this year. In the area of hematology oncology, we'll see data from several Phase III studies, including results from Venclexta's event-driven de novo trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a T114 mutation and Navitoclax' TRANSFORM-1 trial in frontline myelofibrosis. Results from these studies are expected to support regulatory submissions in the second half of the year for Venclexta and navitoclax in their respective indications. We also anticipate regulatory approval this year for epcoritamab in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma in several major geographies, including the U.S. in the second quarter and in Europe and Japan in the second half of the year. Based on the very deep and drillable responses demonstrated thus far in our clinical program, we believe that epcoritamab has the potential to significantly improve upon treatment options for these patients. We believe that epcoritamab has the potential to become a core therapy for B-cell malignancies. And we continue to make very good progress, expanding our development programs for epcoritamab across several indications. Over the course of 2023, we expect to begin several new studies, including a Phase III study in frontline DLBCL in combination with R-CHOP and multiple Phase II studies in CLL and MCL. We remain very excited about epcroritumab's potential to become a best-in-class therapy across multiple B-cell malignancies and look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. Now moving our solid tumor pipeline. We remain on track to see data later this year from our Phase II study evaluating Teliso-V in second-line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. As a reminder, we received a breakthrough therapy designation for Teliso-V, our c-Met ADC, based on the encouraging results from Stage 1 of this Phase II study and the data we'll see later this year has the potential to support an accelerated approval. Our Phase III confirmatory study in patients with overexpressed c-MET is also ongoing. Treatment options for these cancer patients who have exhausted platinum-based chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy are very limited and prognosis for these patients is extremely poor. As a targeted therapy for patients with overexpressed cement which represents approximately 25% of the non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer population, we believe Teliso-V has the potential to become an important new treatment option for these patients. We're also making good progress with our next-generation c-MET ADC, ABBV-400 which utilizes a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload, to potentially drive deeper tumor responses as well as broaden the range of solid tumors where c-MET therapies can be used such as gastroesophageal and colorectal tumors. We expect to see early data from our Phase I program in 2024. Elsewhere in the solid tumor pipeline, we have begun to see encouraging data from several programs which we plan to advance into Phase II studies this year. Our anti-GARP antibody, ABBV-151 is showing strong signals of activity, including deep responses with prolonged durability. Based on this preliminary efficacy, we plan to initiate Phase II studies in several tumor types. We also plan to advance ABBV-647 into Phase II dose optimizing studies this year based on the promising results from our early stage program. This ADC targets PTK7 which is a subset of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and represents approximately 25% of patients and has little overlap with c-MetSo our c-Met ADCs and PTK7 ADC combined will target approximately 45% of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. Now moving to neuroscience, where we recently received FDA approval for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder which marks its fourth indication approval. We're very excited by this approval and pleased with the label which highlights Real or strong benefit risk profile in this indication. Vraylar is an important new treatment option for patients who are currently taking an antidepressant but continue to have unresolved depression symptoms. We also recently received approval in Japan for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. This innovative approach to delivering DUOPA-LIKE efficacy through a subcutaneous delivery system represents a potentially transformative improvement to current treatment options. With a less invasive, nonsurgical delivery system, it also has the potential to significantly expand the patient population currently addressed by DUOPA or other more invasive therapies for advanced PD patients such as deep brain stimulation. We remain on track for approval decisions this year in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we anticipate approval in the first half of the year, with product launch expected in the second half after we secured reimbursement. And in Europe, we anticipate approval in the fourth quarter of this year. And in the area of migraine, we remain on track for an FDA approval decision in the second quarter of this year for QULIPTA as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine. In Europe, we anticipate an approval decision in the third quarter for atogepant as a preventive treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine. If approved, this would be another differentiating feature for Lipa as it would be the only oral CGRP approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. This is a common and debilitating disease that significantly impacts quality of life and we look forward to make this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. And in our aesthetics pipeline, we expect to see results this year from several toxin programs including data from our Phase III study for Botox in platysma prominence with regulatory submission in the U.S. expected near the end of 2023 as well as data from our Phase III study for BOTOX in masseter muscle prominence, where we expect to submit regulatory applications in certain international markets in the second half of the year, including China and Canada. These 2 novel indications for prominent neck and jaw muscles will help to further build our portfolio in the lower phase segment. We'll also see data from our Phase III trial for Bot-AE or short-acting toxin in glabellar lines near the end of this year with regulatory applications plan for 2024. So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones again in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2023 financial outlook. Rob?\\nRob Michael: Thank you, Tom. AbbVie's performance and financial foundation remains strong with our leadership positions across a diverse portfolio, we are well positioned to return to robust growth by 2025. Starting with fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.60 which is $0.07 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.13 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $15.1 billion, up 3.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 2.2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 52.1% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 86% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.5% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.6% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 20.8% of sales. Net interest expense was $476 million and the adjusted tax rate was 13.4%. Turning to our financial outlook for 2023. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $10.70 and $11.10. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year. We expect net revenues of approximately $52 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a neutral impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect immunology sales of $24.8 billion, including SKYRIZI sales of $7.4 billion, reflecting growth of more than $2.2 billion due to strong market share performance across all approved indications. RINVOQ revenue of $3.7 billion, reflecting growth of more than 45% with continued indication expansion and HUMIRA sales of $13.7 billion, including U.S. erosion of 37% and following a loss of exclusivity in late January. With 1 biosimilar currently in the market and potentially 9 more biosimilars available in the middle of the year, we anticipate that sales erosion will be more heavily weighted towards the second half of 2023. In hematologic oncology, we expect VENCLEXTA sales of $2.2 billion and [indiscernible] revenue of $3.5 billion. For aesthetics, we expect sales of $5.2 billion, including $2.5 billion from Botox Cosmetic and $1.4 billion from Juvederm, with growth rates expected to improve when we lap the market slowdown in the middle of the year. For neuroscience, we expect revenue of $7.2 billion representing growth of more than 10%, including Botox Therapeutic sales of $2.8 billion, Vraylar sales of $2.5 billion and total oral CGRP revenue of $1.1 billion, including Ubrelvy growth of approximately 17.5%. For eye care, we expect sales of $2.2 billion and we expect Mavyret revenue of $1.4 billion. Moving to the P&L for 2023. We are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of $6.8 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of $12.4 billion. We forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of 47% of sales. This profile includes a 70 basis point benefit that is fully offset in tax expense given the transition of Puerto Rico's excise tax to an income tax effective at the beginning of this year. We expect adjusted net interest expense of $1.8 billion and we forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be 15.3%, including an impact of 1.3 points from the Puerto Rico tax transition. Finally, we expect our share count to be roughly flat to 2022. Turning to the first quarter. We anticipate net revenues of $11.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas. Immunology sales of $5.5 billion which includes U.S. HUMIRA erosion of 27%, Oncology revenue of $1.4 billion. Aesthetic sales approaching $1.2 billion; Neuroscience revenue of $1.5 billion; and eye care sales approaching $600 million. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of 46% of sales and we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 13.3%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.39 and $2.49. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of nearly $19 billion in 2023 which is net of $1.4 billion in SKYRIZI royalty payments. This cash flow will fully support a strong and growing dividend which we have increased by 270% since inception, continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down $4 billion in maturities this year bringing our cumulative debt reduction to $34 billion. Our strong cash flow also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio. In closing, we are very pleased with AbbVie's strong results in 2022. And with our diverse portfolio, we continue to be well positioned to deliver long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?\\nOperator: Our first question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\\nMohit Bansal: And so maybe a question -- a bigger question for Rick. So AbbVie -- when we talk to investors, AbbVie has always been 1 of those. The R&D as a percent of sales has always been low. And right now, even it is still less than 15% and that's the pushback we get that the company cannot grow organically. And in some ways, you have always been playing defensive given that since inception, HUMIRA has always been an issue. Now that you're beginning to get past that, do you think something you'll change -- you want to change fundamentally with the company and the way you allocate internal versus external R&D spend? That would be very helpful.\\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. This is Rick. So it's a good question. We've obviously heard that question. I think there's a number of dynamics that play into it. when you look at our R&D expense as a profile. One is, obviously, we have a large volume of HUMIRA revenue that requires relatively little R&D support. And so that obviously dilutes out the profile of the business. As we see biosimilar impact, obviously, there will be some impact on that as you know, our revenues were to go down. The second thing is the aesthetics business, we're funding it aggressively to grow it. But by definition, it's not that expensive to be able to fund many of those programs. So it has a much lower profile. So some of it is mix when you think about it. The second thing I'd say is we obviously fund R&D at a level that we believe we can drive productivity. And I think if you look at our productivity over the last 10 years, the data I've seen suggests we are 1 of the most productive R&D engines in the industry. Certainly, when you look at products like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, the return on those assets is tremendous. The third thing I'd say is, look, what drives R&D expense to the greatest extent is when you have large volumes of Phase III programs. And we're coming into a phase as we move forward over the next 3 or 4 years, where we have a number of programs that if they are successful, they will create a scenario where we will increase R&D. So an example of that would be our GARP program. We've seen some incredibly encouraging data out of that program thus far to next-generation immuno-oncology program. That combines with checkpoint inhibitors. And if that program continues to advance the way we see it now, we would want to expand our as our Phase II and then Phase III trials in that program significantly across the relatively broad range of solid tumors. That will require a significant increase in investment to be able to do that. So we tend to drive R&D based on programs that we have a high level of confidence can be productive and can be successful. And we don't constrain R&D in any way from that perspective. Another program will be our AbbVie program. If that program proves to deliver high rates of amyloid reduction and low REA. That will be another program that we want to rapidly move into Phase III. And so I can tell you, I'm very comfortable with the productivity we're getting out of R&D. Certainly, we will want to continue to increase that and that's 1 of our objectives. We always look at programs on the outside to bring them in. And in fact, I'd say over the last couple of years, we brought in a number of programs that are earlier stage programs. And we're fortunate from the standpoint that we have the ability to drive very strong growth, as we've indicated to investors between now and the end of this decade. We can drive high single-digit growth. We're going to return to robust growth in '25. So we're looking mostly for assets that will allow us to drive growth in that late 20s and early 30s time frame. So again, as those mature and they're successful and they go into later-stage development programs, they will drive further need for investment.\\nRob Michael: Mohit, this is Rob. I'll just add that. If you look at this year's guide, it's a great example of our willingness to increase R&D investment where it's needed. So if you look at we're increasing it from $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion. Those increases are focused on epcoritamab as well as midstage assets such as GARP and PTK7. We also have several new Phase III studies for additional RINVOQ indications which could contribute several billion dollars of revenue in the latter half of the decade. So even in the year where we're seeing a decline in the top line, we're increasing R&D investments. We're very committed to increasing innovation investment, whether it's internal or external.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\\nTerence Flynn: I guess, I just wondered, high level, if there was anything different, Rick, or Rob, about your approach to guidance on the revenue side this year versus last year. I think last year, performance was choppy across a number of different franchises. So as you thought about the guidance this year, anything different as you approached it? And then my second question is any other details you can provide on how you're thinking about HUMIRA in 2024. Obviously, I appreciate the color this year but how should we think about 2024 dynamics in the U.S.\\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. So maybe I'll start and then Rob can fill in anything that I might miss. I think whenever we look at guidance, we look at it and I think this has been our historical practice. We obviously look at guidance as something that we have a very high level that we can execute against that guidance. I would say this year, you've seen that the range is a little bit wider than what we normally project. And we did that based on the fact that as HUMIRA goes biosimilar, obviously, very small changes in the assumptions we're making on erosion for HUMIRA can have a fairly significant impact. So we're right in the range by about $0.10. and that's reflected in this guidance. And so I would say that as we have in historically, we have a high level of confidence we're going to deliver on this guidance. As it relates to 2024, we have provided as part of this guidance, what we are projecting to be a floor because we've gotten a lot of requests from investors about when will we hit the trough and will it be '23 or will it be '24? So maybe to give you a little color around how we think about that. One, the $10.70 is a floor. That doesn't mean that we will go down to $10.70 but it means that we would say to investors that, that's what you should assume is the absolute floor. Now when will that or if it were to occur, when we occur? Will we see the drop in 2023? Or will we see the trough in 2024. And I would tell you that our expectations would be based on this plan, the trough should occur in 2023. But what I would tell you is if we significantly overachieved this plan into 2023 and there's obviously somewhat greater risk it could move into '24. The reason why it is in '23 versus '24 based on our current planning assumptions, is because the strength of the growth platform has the ability between where it will grow in '23 and where we're growing 24% to offset what will obviously be further erosion of HUMIRA in 2024. 2024, you will basically have to impacts on HUMIRA. You will have the annualization of this year. And as Rob said in his remarks, we expect more of an impact in the second half of '23. So when you annualize that, you're going to have an impact that flows through to '24. And then we would expect further erosion of HUMIRA, both price and probably to a greater extent, volume in 2024. But the growth platform has the ability to grow through that based on those assumptions. And so that's the philosophy that we operate with on the guidance. Rob, anything you'd add?\\nRob Michael: I think if you reflect back on the history of AbbVie, we've had a long track record at delivering exceeding our guidance. I think 2022 is an exception. And if you look at on the top line now, we didn't make earnings. So that's important to highlight. If you look at the top line, the 2 biggest factors that drove the miss versus original guidance in 2022 were with Imbruvica and Venclexta, the CLO market, we did not anticipate that, that market would actually not recover. I mean that's -- it's down 20% versus pre-pandemic levels. And then we did see some additional share impact on IMBRUVICA. And then aesthetics, we saw, obviously, in the month of May, we started to see a slowdown in the economy. We had a very strong first quarter. So both of those things really are what drove the top line miss, we made earnings. Now we have factored both those things in the 2023 guidance to give investors confidence that we said it appropriately. But we always look to set the most responsible guidance we can and we feel good about where we set 2023.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\\nChris Schott: Just 2 for me. Maybe just following up on the 2023 guidance being a trough number. It seems like you're still going to have about a $12 billion U.S. HUMIRA franchise here. So can you just provide maybe a little bit more color of what you're envisioning 2024 to look like for HUMIRA? Like is it reasonable to think about the down 35% to 40% year as we look out to '24. I think we just turn your hands around just the how much growth in that core platform and how much of a headwind, I guess, HUMIRA is going to be facing at the same time. My second question was just on aesthetics trends as we move through this year. You've talked about some signs of at least sequential stability the last few quarters. You're talking about stepping up investments. You've got a couple of new products launching. I guess why shouldn't we think about some recovery in this business as we look out to the second half of the year?\\nRick Gonzalez: Chris, this is Rick. Let me talk a little bit about HUMIRA and the trough. We're 2 weeks into the biosimilar activity. So it's a little difficult to give you precise predictions or 2024. I think the way to think about HUMIRA going forward is what we would expect is the most significant impact on HUMIRA is going to be price. And obviously, we're trying to predict going forward what that price will look like. Certainly, as we look at this year, the most significant impact is clearly price. So that's more predictable because we obviously know what the pricing is in the contracts that we've put together. And so I think that's something that we have a high level of confidence. There will be further pressure on price as we move into '24 and there'll probably be further pressure on volume in '24d. But I would say, at the end of '24, I would expect HUMIRA to start to develop a more stable tail of revenue. It will still have some pressure as we move in '25 but '25 and '26 is where we should see that more stable tail for HUMIRA emerge. And that's 1 of the things that allows us to be able to see the underlying growth from the growth platform. So a number of things happen between '23 and '24 and then '25 as we move forward. As you mentioned in your second comment, we would certainly expect that the U.S. economy will start to recover in '24. It may recover earlier than that. And if it does, that would be great. We don't want to put a plan together to assume that because obviously, that's difficult for us to predict. But I think we would all expect that 24 will see a recovery in the U.S. economy. And we would fully expect for the aesthetics business to return back to historical growth rates very quickly when that happens. And so that will be another opportunity for that business to be able to grow. And then I would say Imbruvica is the other key issue for us. as we move forward. We would expect the majority of the erosion that we see on Imbruvica will occur this year and there will be less downward pressure as we move to '24. So that's what allows the growth to be able to come up. What I would tell you even though I don't want to make a; prediction in '24 of what HUMIRA will look like. I think we have a high level of confidence that we have the ability if the erosion curve looks like how we've modeled it now between '23 and '24 that we have the ability to be able to have the growth platform and go through that. So we can absorb that impact. And so far, like I said, it's early on but I'd say so far, we're comfortable with how things are playing out. Rob, anything you want to add on the first question and Carrie, maybe you can give a little more color.\\nRob Michael: I think you characterized it well, Rick. I mean the thing to highlight for this year for '23, the way you think about HUMIRA really in the first half of the year, the vast majority of that erosion will be priced. In the second half, you'll see because we've contracted rebates, you'll see a step-up in the price erosion, although you also will see more volume with biosimilars coming in the market in the middle of the year, we would expect more volume erosion. I think as we think about '24, we would expect, based on the contract to see a step up in price but albeit not at the same level as we see in '23 but '24 would be more volume. It's probably the best way to think about it right now. We're not going to give you guidance but if you think about how to model HUMIRA '23, '24, that's the way to think through it.\\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. Carrie, anything you want to add on aesthetics?\\nCarrie Strom: Yes. This is Carrie. The -- in terms of the aesthetics market and how we're thinking about it for 2023, I mean, first, I'd say, yes, this is still a very strong fundamental market with consumers who are very interested in entering the category. And so that remains a strong opportunity the now and in the future. But what we saw as we exited 2022 is as these economic metrics were softening, we also saw that reflected in demand for aesthetic procedures. And in our conversations with customers, we saw that reflected in their practices, market research with consumers, where they said, yes, we're interested in the category but we want to see what's going on with the economy, perhaps before a new patient might want to enter the category. And based on that, we are modeling for those trends to continue in 2023. And what that means for U.S. toxin market is the market growth would be around a mid-single-digit decline for U.S. filler market around a 10% decline. And like we said, those growth rates would be different by quarter as we lap a strong first part of the year. Now of course, if there is a scenario like a deep recession, where unemployment skyrockets, that is not something that we've contemplated. Or on the other hand, if the macroeconomic environment stabilizes or improve that would represent favorability to our plan.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Gary Nachman with BMO Capital Markets.\\nGary Nachman: First question is on neuro in the quarter. It's actually weaker than we thought. So was there any additional pressure on gross to net, maybe for the oral CGRPs? And what sort of inflection are you expecting for Vraylar and MDD, how rapid do you think that adoption might be this year? And then, Rick, you recently said that you would be in an article that you would be lifting the self-imposed $2 billion annual cap on business development that you have more capacity to do deals. So how much capacity do you guys have what areas are you looking to be most aggressive? And how important is it to add sizable marketed products into the mix? Or would it be mostly focused on pipeline?\\nJeff Stewart: Yes. I'll take the first one, it's Jeff. Thanks for the question. No, we did not see material incremental pressure on the gross to net -- we did see a little softening versus our expectation on the overall preventative marketplace but it was quite modest. So no, fairly consistent trending. I mean if you look at our new prescription capture and the oral market, it's basically a 50-50 shared capture rate between ourselves and the major competitor. In terms of the Vraylar adoption trend, we had discussed previously because we really have very, very strong access for Vraylar that we would anticipate a pretty rapid inflection in adoption for the depression indication, the adjunctive depression indication. As I mentioned in my remarks, that's what we've seen. So we're quite encouraged. I mean we can see a significant trend break on the new prescription adoption versus what was already a very nice growth rate for the bipolar 1 indication. So I think the early dynamics and again, it's only really been a month here in January where our sales force has been out promoting the new indication. We're quite encouraged in terms of the market response, both from the metrics in terms of IQVIA, the scripts we see but also the qualitative feedback from the customers.\\nRick Gonzalez: And on deal capacity, we obviously look at business development based on what we believe are -- we're trying to accomplish strategically in each of the therapeutic areas that we're operating in. we identify areas that we think would be good opportunities for us and then we look to see if we can find those kinds of assets. As I mentioned before, I think we're in the fortune of a position that we can drive very strong growth. with the assets that we have on the market today as well as what's coming out of our pipeline over the next 3 or 4 years. That gives us the ability to be able to return to growth and then drive that high single-digit growth through the end of the decade. And we're also fortunate that after HUMIRA, we have a -- relative to our peers, we have a very low LOE [ph] exposure. So we don't have a lot of downward pressure on the business. Now having said that, we've done an excellent job of paying down the incremental debt from the Allergan transaction, we put that $2 billion cap in place when we did the Allergan acquisition that allowed us to focus again on some earlier-stage assets. And I'd remind everyone that was about 4x what our historical practice has been for those kinds of assets. So there was plenty of capacity to do that. But we're certainly in a position now that if the right thing were to come along, we could do a transaction that would be much larger. We certainly have the financial wherewithal to be able to do that. And we've certainly shown that we were able to do that and create value in the assets that we bring in. The areas that we typically look at are aligned with our therapeutic growth areas. So immunology, oncology, certain areas of neuroscience and eye care, I would say, are the predominant areas as well as aesthetics. We obviously continue to look for opportunities in the states. They tend to be smaller acquisitions, though. And so at the end of the day, I feel good about where we are and we've been quite active. We have a very active business development group. And we'll continue to look at those. And like I said, we find something that's of interest and it could really help us round out a category that we're in, then you should expect us to act on that.\\nOperator: It comes from Carter Gould with Barclays.\\nCarter Gould: Maybe to come back to aesthetics. It does sound like you built in conservatism on a number of fronts. I wanted to also -- you didn't touch much around sort of China reopening and how you expect that sort of business to -- as it comes back, if you expect it to sort of return to how it was? Or if that will evolve differently. And then in the -- I guess as we think then around the guidance for '23 and the link you've drawn to as you sort of maybe if the guidance potentially evolves over '23, should we think about that link remaining intact? Or is that sort of a near-term phenomenon and that will sort of, I guess, disappear going forward.\\nRick Gonzalez: Carrie, why don't you touch on the aesthetics question.\\nCarrie Strom: Yes. So your question around China and I'd say China is our second largest global business. It has demonstrated significant growth in the past few years and proven to be very responsive to the increased promotion that we're putting into that market. Of course, in 2022, China COVID-related issues did impact the aesthetics market, especially in the second and fourth quarters. Now, as we look at the year beginning in China and as everyone is returning from the Chinese New Year, it does look like the current wave has peaked. And that the situation is beginning to improve and will continue to improve through the first half of 2023 and we're expecting a full recovery in the market in Q3 and for the second half the year. So despite the challenges in 2022, China still posted positive growth and we will definitely be continuing our investments in China in 2023 and beyond.\\nRob Michael: And Carter, this is Rob. I'll try to answer your second question. I think the way to think about '24 -- clearly, as we go through the year, we always look at the trends and contemplate what that could mean for flow through in '24. But the reason we gave you that guidance range, we mentioned the $10.70 [ph] being the way to think about it as a floor for '24 is because of the dynamics around the HUMIRA erosion. So if we do better in '23 and more of it happens in '24, then you can at least anchor back to we're not going to fall below that $10.70 EPS floor in our guidance range. So we always would factor in trends but that's the way to think about it. If it's just the erosion on HUMIRA is better this year than we have in this guidance. We want to make sure you understood that what it means potentially for '24. So that's again, always factor in trends. But as we sit here today, that's the best way to think about it.\\nRick Gonzalez: Maybe just let me add 1 thing that might help clarify it. I think you should think about HUMIRA in '24. We believe we're going to get to a certain level of price and volume in '24, almost regardless of what happens in 2013 because of the competitive dynamic. And so when we talk about the shift, what we're really talking about is inflating '23. If you anchor '24 is a solid point that we have a high level of confidence of where HUMIRA's tail will be in '24. And the only thing that happens to shift it between '23 and '24 is that we do much better in '23 than we expected, right? So that inflates but it still anchors against the '24 point [ph]. That's the way to think about this.\\nOperator: It comes from Steve Scala with Cowen.\\nSteve Scala: The low end of 2023 guidance implies 22% EPS erosion, the high end of Q1 guidance assumes 21% EPS erosion. How is it possible that Q1 could be in line with the full year and not appreciably better? It seems as though the Q1 guide is low? Or is that because AbbVie believes the floor on HUMIRA price is already reached? Maybe another way to restate the question. What should be our anticipation for the quarterly cadence of EPS as we go through the year?\\nRob Michael: So Steve, so I think the best way is 1 anchor on the guidance we gave you on U.S. HUMIRA today. So we said for the first quarter, we said it would be 27% erosion. And so -- and that's going to -- the vast majority of that will be priced. And we said because there'll be 9 biosimilars coming to market in the middle of the year, we would expect more of the erosion to come in the second half of the year. So you have to factor that dynamic into the way you look at the quarters that there'll be more erosion in the second half of the year for HUMIRA versus the first half of the year. Then you also have to factor in that you've got things like aesthetics, we haven't quite lapped the economic impact yet, right? So in the first quarter, you have a dynamic where you will see aesthetics still down, right? But when we get into the middle of the year, when we lap it, that also affects your year-over-year growth rates. And then, the underlying performance of the growth platform as we continue to drive those brands, you'll see those growth rates accelerate. So those are all the things that would factor as you look at the quarterly -- really, we've given you Q1 and then full year. We haven't given you Q2, 3 and 4. But that -- those are the variables I would look at. There's not really a whole lot in terms of if you look at investment, for example, that you have to flex. We do tend to see some higher levels typically in the fourth quarter. So, you could -- you could look at historically our investment patterns and use that as a proxy. But those are the variables to consider as you think about the first quarter versus the rest of the year.\\nOperator: It will come from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\\nTim Anderson: I'm going to torch you with a couple more questions on the same subject as others. The U.S. HUMIRA erosion guidance of minus 37% in '23. How much of that is price versus volume? If I look at what your Q1 U.S. HUMIRA erosion is, so the guidance is minus 27%. Given that volumes for HUMIRA are, call it, 5% positive, that would suggest the price cuts may be in the 30% to 35% range. So can we triangulate off of the Q1 guidance to understand what percent of that minus 37% comes from price? And then the second question, again, goes back to 2024. I know there's lots of uncertainty on the exact rate of erosion for HUMIRA '23. But if you hit that minus 37% right on the nose, would 2024 erosion likely be slower or faster than net minus 37%.\\nRob Michael: So Tim, on your question related to price and volume. The way to think about it is in the first half of the year, the 27% in the first quarter, is the vast majority of that is price, right? So there is some volume impact but not very much. it's in the second half, what you'll see is in the second half, the overall erosion will step up and think of it as equivalent between price and volume because you're going to have -- we know we'll have rebate rates in some cases, increasing as well as the biosimilars coming to market, we expect to see more volume erosion. So as you think about -- as you're trying to triangulate the price volume with the guidance you've given, 27% vast majority's price, second half of the year, you'll have some more volume kicking in. That's I think the best way to think about the price volume split. And then your question on '24, is your question in terms of the percentage or the absolute percentage [ph]?\\nTim Anderson: So, if you hit the minus 37% this year which is your guidance for U.S. HUMIRA, the rate of erosion in '24 would be greater or less than that 37%?\\nRob Michael: So we're not going to give you a 2024 guidance, Tim. I think the way to think about '24 is we would expect to see additional price but albeit not at the same level as '23 and more volume coming through because you're going to have up to 10 biosimilars in the market for the full year. So we would expect to see more of a volume impact in '24 that we would expect to see in '23.\\nOperator: It comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\\nChris Shibutani: You previously commented about the operating margin trajectory of '23 into '24. I believe characterizing them is basically flattish. Is that still the case? And then across the immunology category broadly, we're seeing some -- a lot of cross-currency [ph] mix dynamics, clearly, with your portfolio being part of that. What is your expectation about the potential for some of the newer mechanisms that are emerging with clinical data. Are you keen to figure out whether you want to invoke those as part of your portfolio? What do you see the outlook for novel mechanisms, given that we're going to have some biosimilars to some of the most standard of care approaches PNSIL-23.\\nRob Michael: Chris, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. I think for modeling purposes, I would expect operating margins stay roughly at this level in '24 and then begin expanding again in with our return to robust sales growth. I think the pace of that expansion will depend on investment needs as we will always prioritize R&D and SG&A investment to drive long-term growth but that's the best way to think through '24 and then what the operating margin will look like in '25 and beyond.\\nJeff Stewart: And Chris, it's Jeff. I'll maybe kick off on your immunology question and then ask Tom to comment on some dynamics as well. So it is very, very clear that certainly in the midterm, the most excitement across these immunology categories are for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. It's quite striking. And I think Tom mentioned there's still incredible interest in a next wave of dermatologic indications that follow on for atopic dermatitis that he highlighted. And really, as I noted in my remarks, I mean, the amount of excitement around the IL-23 and particularly our IL-23 across these indications is really profound. Now having said that, we are watching the competitive landscape for some maybe potentially some novel orals. We don't see them as major players. As we look deeper in the pipeline, we can see that there is the possibility for combination use of novel biologics or biomarker-driven approaches, particularly in IBD. And we monitor those very carefully as we look at our long-range plan. And Tom, I don't know if you want to address some of the things that are back in our pipeline in terms of immunology.\\nTom Hudson: Sure. I mean I think the -- I just want to start saying that with SKYRIZI and RINVOQ really raised the bar in terms of efficacy and you see it in mucosal healing, for example. So the bar is getting higher and we will continue to do that. But even to show that we're raising the bar, we're also going to do -- we're going to read out head-to-head studies this year with STELARA and Otezla. So another way to kind of show that what we have is really very profound in terms of responses we're seeing with patients. And we continue -- I mean, honestly, we look at the field. We look at competitors. We're hearing data of S1P1 inhibitors but the data appears to be less effective based on a number of patients which are discontinuing treatment and the signals that we see cardiovascular and others that are similar to what we've seen with previous ones. So I mean, again, without having seen the data, it's all difficult to kind of predict how they'll be able to do accept that our data with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI are very strong, durable and again, very strong at the level of endoscopy also. So we think we have already a competitive edge. We continue we'll see PMR data later this year. We have talked about our RIPK1 inhibitor, again, from the coal healing that's in the clinic right now. We're looking at additional indications. So over time, obviously, we're going to look at additional mechanisms. But not necessarily just pushing down on the same cytokines as JAKs but looking at other target pathways of things that happen in the scan or in GI, again, mucosal healing being an tool pathway. And this is where we think a combination of our immunomodulators like RINVOQ and SKYRIZI with other mechanisms will combine well to give even more profound responses.\\nOperator: It comes from Colin Bristow with UBS.\\nColin Bristow: For all the helpful color so far. So maybe a broader question just with regards to HUMIRA biosimilars. I just I'm curious like, what is the broader impact you anticipate on the I&I market just in terms of net price has been sort of a question we've been getting a lot of people are trying to wrap their heads around -- and then maybe just one on your CF triple. I know that the trial is ongoing. Can you give us an update here? How is the progress? Should we still expect data later this year?\\nJeff Stewart: Yes, I'll take the one on the immunology marketplace. I think that the impact overall in the category for net price would be modest. And I think a lot of it has to do what Tom and I've discussed before which is the -- just the pure profile of some of these agents particularly SKYRIZI and RINVOQ and either others in the pipeline that are coming. I mean they really are setting different standards of care versus what they've seen in the past. And certainly, the physicians and the payers are recognizing this. I'll give a really quick example on 1 of our major products which is RINVOQ. I mean RINVOQ, based on the label changes that have taken place is already a post-TNF type of dynamic. And so the pricing is going to be the pricing there's no incremental ability to step it, for example. The other thing I would note is on SKYRIZI, we have 4 head-to-head trials against all the major competitors and another one coming with Otezla, as Tom noted. So you start to see that level of performance, whether it's against STELARA, multiple TNFs. Otezla, as I said, that's pending here. And it just becomes very clear that you're just going to achieve much higher levels of clearance and relief. So we feel pretty confident that the pricing impact over time, particularly in the U.S. market will be very modest. And certainly, we can navigate that based on the power of the performance of the portfolio.\\nTom Hudson: This is Tom. I'll just answer about the cystic fibrosis program. Again, this program continues. And just to remind you, we're working on a triplet and where we believe that 2 of the 3 components of -- for this drug, this triplet, we have best-in-class assets. But we were looking for another part of the triple called the C2 corrector, where last year, the previous ones basically didn't give the meaningful improvement we were expecting in FEV1 sweat chloride. So we've actually, in our discovery groups, continue to develop new ones. In the last year, we've moved our ABBV-576 forward. in SAD in Phase I studies. We continue to see these, again, safety, high exposures, good PK, things that with -- if you combine with our preclinical data, makes us think it will, it has a potential to be best-in-class -- and that's triplet again with -- is -- first of all, to being tested, we'll have data this year to actually show how they behave together. And later at this part of this year, I'll be able to give an update.\\nOperator: Our next question is from [indiscernible] with Credit Suisse.\\nUnidentified Analyst: Trung [ph] from Credit Suisse. Two, if I may. So I was just wondering on your thoughts more broadly on the pricing dynamics in the EU and U.S. So in the EU, you recently exited the U.K. pricing agreement. In Europe, it does feel like there's -- it's just becoming an increasingly complicated pricing environment. There are a number of reforms being proposed in Europe. So I guess my first question is, is do you see these changes being material or any headwinds to you in your growth ex U.S.? And then secondly, can you just perhaps talk about your reasons you decided not to renew your membership for pharma and bio. How are you going to remain engaged in D.C. and have a voice when it comes to things like IRA and pricing controls.\\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take the first one there in terms of the EU. We do see some movement there, particularly in the, let's say, industry tax and I'll comment on the so-called VPaaS [ph] in the U.K. In some ways, whether or not we were in that voluntary program or outside of the voluntary program, the impact is about the same. And frankly, it was a policy decision because we really think that the U.K. government needs to reform that VPaaS. They didn't plan properly for how things might dynamically evolve in the U.K. and it's a very substantial part of the revenue now that is causing problems, I think, across all of the company. So it was a position of policy position, net neutral. It didn't matter, frankly, whether we were in or not and the U.K. is a relatively modest business for us. We are seeing perhaps more importantly, some changes in the German law, as you're probably aware of. And that is, I think, a modest net pressure that will come in Europe in Germany, in particular, because there's the move, as you may know, from 1 year of free pricing to 6 months. There's a modest increase in rebates, for example. So we do see some austerity impact. But on the bigger scheme, it's -- I wouldn't say it's material to our growth platform that we've been discussing.\\nRob Michael: And Trung [ph], this is Rob. In terms of international prices, I mean, typically, we see year-over-year decline of low to mid-single digits and that's the way we're modeling it for '23 as well.\\nRick Gonzalez: And then on pharma, this is Rick. Obviously, every year, we evaluate any kind of significant investment that we're going to make. And we make a decision as to whether or not we believe that investment is appropriate and is going to have the right level of return at that point in time. And ultimately, we made the decision around pharma based on that. We have a very significant government affairs group that's been active and been in place ever since we came into existence. Back in 2013, we've grown that organization. We did grow it somewhat this year as well in anticipation of not being part of pharma. We plan on being active as we have been in the past to try to appropriately advocate for things that we think are appropriate for patients. And I think that group is quite capable of being able to do that. And I would tell you that at a point in the future, we might decide to go back into pharma. But at this point, we've made the decision that we think that investment could be used elsewhere to be more effective. It's as simple as that.\\nOperator: Our next question is from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\\nGeoffrey Meacham: I appreciate all the perspective on guidance. I just had a follow-up on it. Rick, on your comments on the HUMIRA scale for starting next year in the U.S. I think when you look at other geographies, international revenues, you're still seeing double-digit declines after 4 years or so. Maybe just give us some context for what you're seeing there broadly versus what we could expect for the U.S. And just to be clear, when you see next year the impact from all the HUMIRA biosimilars, how much do you think that biosimilar STELARA may play a role here when you look at your assumptions for HUMIRA erosion? And then second question, just on the BD front, you guys talked about some of the therapeutic categories that you're interested in. But with the appetite to expand to expand the menu here and to say more orphan indications, I think across the landscape, some companies in the I&I space are getting into more niche indication. I wasn't sure if that was something that you guys would consider?\\nRick Gonzalez: So I think on the HUMIRA tail, just to maybe clarify what I said is I would expect that as we move through 2024 then in 2025 and 2026, we would start to see a more stable tail for HUMIRA. In other words, we're going to see erosion in 2024. I want to make sure I didn't somehow communicate that, that wasn't the case. So if you look at OUS, I think what's probably deceiving to you is you had different countries going biosimilar at different periods in time. So you can't necessarily look at that as an analog because it's so heterogeneous in the year that those countries went biosimilars. So you are correct. Yes, it is still experiencing double-digit decline but it's been driven by the fact that those countries have not -- some of those countries haven't reached stability yet. But typically -- and the U.S. market is a little different because you have all a large number -- you have a small number of large payers who drive the bulk of the activity in this market. So, it's more like some of the countries that did other kinds of government-wide activity, like in Germany as an example. And there, we do see after a couple of years, we've seen stability. So I think what's misleading you is you're looking at the overall number but you're not factoring into that, the fact that these countries went biosimilar across a number of years.\\nRob Michael: Jeff, this is Rob. Just to add to that. So if you just look at this year, so about half of the erosion is going to come from newer markets like Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico. So that, as Rick mentioned, we have different waves. And so you're still seeing some of those waves come through. You also have some volume going to new agents like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, right? So that's something to keep in mind that that's a dynamic that's also playing out for HUMIRA in those markets. And then you typically see negative price trends in international markets, again, low to mid-single digits. So you're going to see some level of pressure there. So those are all factoring into the year-over-year on international HUMIRA something to make sure you're keeping in mind.\\nJeff Stewart: And if you look at the STELARA dynamic with the biosimilar, I think there's a couple of dynamics that we're watching. And it does go back to my prior comments over the clinical differentiation. The first is that there will be less biosimilar competitive intensity against STELARA. Certainly, we've not seen anything like the 9 that we were -- 9 or 10 [ph] that we're going to see on HUMIRA. And so -- and that price point is quite high actually. If you look at where Stellar is now with the branded program. Now I think maybe more importantly, as we've highlighted before, we've anticipated that entry. And certainly, in Crohn's, we have an ongoing head-to-head trial against STELARA that will read out towards the end of the year. We plan on putting that into promotion if and we believe it will be positive, particularly what we're studying which is that endoscopic endpoint which is really becoming the standard in the gastroenterology space. So we think we can carry quite well with the ultimate arrival of that IL -- the 12/23 [ph] versus our Pure '23. So I hope that helps.\\nRick Gonzalez: I think on your third question, again, what tends to drive our BD strategy is the long-term strategic road map that we put in place across the branch. So if you think about it, you mentioned immunology as an example. I would say in immunology, we have 2 fundamental objectives that we're trying to drive. There are still areas within immunology, where we believe we can significantly raise the effectiveness of the therapies that are used on patients to drive higher levels of remission or higher levels of endoscopic healing. In other words, better clinical outcomes within the areas that we're in. And so we have a tremendous amount of effort in those areas to bring next-generation assets or as Tom mentioned in his comments, there are opportunities to potentially combine 2 mechanisms together to achieve that level of therapeutic benefit. But then we look outside those areas at the adjacencies. And we look for where are the opportunities for us to be able to bring in either an existing mechanism or something we can either develop within our own discovery group or something that we can acquire on the outside as a mechanism that we don't currently have. But we tend to look for where there are areas of large unmet needs and relatively significant patient populations. So, I use 2 examples to illustrate. Vitiligo. Vitiligo is a disease that's very prevalent. There aren't good therapeutic options in it today at all. We do believe there are mechanisms that will allow you to effectively treat vitiligo. If those are effective, that could be a very significant opportunity overtime. Alopecia is another good example of that. So that's how we focus BD in these areas. That's not to say we would never look at a more much opportunity or an orphan opportunity but I wouldn't say orphan is something that is core to our strategy.\\nOperator: It comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.\\nRobyn Karnauskas: It was great with all the color you've given. I just had some -- I want to follow up on, you mentioned Vitiligo. With the competition with topical rux [ph] which might have a first mover advantage and then they have an oral as well in Pfizer. How do you see the opportunity for you in vitiligo for RINVOQ? Can it compete? And then my second question last earnings call, you highlighted your GARP TGF beta. So that's 151. And I know there's been a lot of cardio-tox [ph] in the space. So what gives you some confidence what features and what indications, like how do you focus on this? And how do you view the competition profile?\\nRick Gonzalez: On vitiligo, maybe Jeff and I will tag team on it. I would certainly say a topical has a place but it is difficult for people that have large areas of their bodies that are impacted by something like vitiligo for a topical to be a manageable therapy for those patients. So an oral for those patients that have more severe disease typically has greater benefit and frankly, better compliance among those patients which ultimately gives you better clinical outcomes. So I think the RINVOQ will stack up against whoever the competitive alternatives are based on the data. Based on how we've seen RINVOQ perform in other areas, I think we feel pretty good about what the potential is. But the data will speak for itself, see what the data looks like Jeff and Tom, would you add anything?\\nJeff Stewart: Just to build on that. When we look at the valuation of, for example, that indication or HS or alopecia which again are those derm oriented indications that will follow on pretty quickly in the middle of the decade on top of atopic dermatitis. We do exactly what Rick highlighted. We will segment the patients based on the body surface area. We know that the topicals will be important for a certain percentage of population. For example, if it's maybe highly located to the face, that might be more appropriate, at least as the first course of action. But we do believe that in almost all indications that we've looked at for RINVOQ, it just performs exceptionally well in the clinic. And we would anticipate that as well above a base case scenario. Perfect example is Crohn's disease. There will not be another JAK inhibitor in Crohn's disease for the United States just because they just don't work. And you have spectacular results with the selective JAK with RINVOQ. So We take that all into that competitive context all into our calculations as we look forward to return for those future derm indications.\\nTom Hudson: If I can just continue with. I mean, we will have readouts for our Phase II study this year and we've mostly been looking at those cases where there's more extensive body coverage disease -- or the face. So I think it would be a different -- it's a much better to take an oral than a cream when you actually have significant body coverage. Again, we'll see the data, we will report on another quarter call. Thank you, Robin, for the second question. Yes, TGF-beta is a known tumor suppressive pathway and people have tried to drug it to increase the response to immunotherapies. The first-generation TGF-beta because the target is so many parts of the body, you actually have effects, the cardiovascular effects having related to the TGF-beta activity in some of the endothelial cells in the valves and so on of the heart. Here, we're using GARP as our target. GARP is actually a receptor for TGF-beta that's called latent inactive that GARP sound only on Treg cells, a little bit on some fiber some store sales but it's not some in the heart or other tissues. That's what gives us our safety profile and the ability to causing a suppression on Treg cells found in tumor cells as opposed to other places in the body. So that we felt from the beginning was the attribute we needed to go to target this pathway would be something that will be tumor selective and that's what we've been able to see so far.\\nRick Gonzalez: She asked about what tumors potentially.\\nTom Hudson: Tumors. So in our -- initially, we focused on tumors. So this pathway is found on almost every solid tumor has some subset tumors which express TGF-beta and GARP. We started off thinking that we'd do a Phase I SAC [ph] study which we did well that we will expand. And we had picked liver and bladder because we saw a lot of TGF-beta pathway in those indications. And we also -- although we knew there was 7 CRC, we saw in patients in our Phase I study which were unselected in terms of tumor type. We saw responses. So we've actually continued expanding studying CRC but we did see responses in liver cancer where we expected to see it based on expression of TGF-beta. We did see it in bladder cancer and we're expanding in those indications at this point. Given the fact that I said earlier that we TGF-beta in all types of tumors, both tumors called hot or cold, we're actually expanding in other tumors to get signals right now. And again, we have we'll have baskets to actually continue to explore its indication space. But right now, we're expanding when we're going to Phase II dose rating studies that's indications where we've actually seen data in our Phase I study.\\nOperator: It comes from Simon Baker with Redburn.\\nSimon Baker: Two, if I may, please. Just going back to U.S. HUMIRA. Giving us the expected erosion is extremely helpful. It's also extremely impressive that you confident enough to give a point estimate for the percentage erosion in '23. So notwithstanding that, I wonder if you could give us what the likely pushes and pulls are. Is this something where we should be thinking more about the being upside risk due to inability of those additional generics biosimilars to supply the market. So any color pushes and pulls there and also into 2024 and your confidence around the erosion curve in '24? And then a question on tax. One question topic that's been raised by some of your peers has been an impact from the OECD minimum global tax rate initiatives in '23. Your guidance would suggest that isn't a factor for you. I just wonder if you could give us any color on when and if you expect those initiatives to impact your tax rate?\\nRob Michael: Simon, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. So when we give guidance, we typically give approximate assumptions and we do use point estimates. We don't typically give product level range. So it has been our practice. So we said approximately 37% erosion for U.S. HUMIRA. We have confidence in that number, obviously. But I think in terms of the pushes and pulls, it's really going to be about volume erosion, right? I think that's -- if you think over the course of the year, we made assumptions around volume erosion. We have good visibility of the price. Now it's a question of what will the volume erosion look like? And obviously, as we go through the year, we'll update you on that.\\nScott Reents: This is Scott. I'll give you some thoughts on the OECD question that you asked regarding tax. So you're right. For 2023, we do not see any impact from this. In our view, there's a lot of things to be worked out with respect to the global minimum tax you mentioned. We have, in the U.S., as you know, a minimum tax we see ultimately this OECD tax being a top-up on that if that does occur but there's a lot of details to be worked out and we wouldn't anticipate any impact there until 2025, if there is an impact.\\nOperator: It comes from Navann Ty with BNP Parabas.\\nNavann Ty: I have 3 quick follow-ups, please. The first 1 on aesthetics, in addition to the macro impact. Are you seeing or do you expect increasing competition from your smaller competitors, DTC campaigns and new products? The second question is on HUMIRA. Was AMGEVITA in line with your expectation. And the third follow-up is on capital allocation. So can we think of 2x as a soft net leverage target which is relevant for AbbVie to consider material business development.\\nRick Gonzalez: Carrie?\\nCarrie Strom: I'll take that first question on aesthetic competition. So in terms of U.S. BOTOX [ph] Cosmetics, this is a product that's around for 20 years and has based increased competition and still commands market-leading market share in the high 60s. And we know though that the competitive market will expand as new entrants are coming and have entered and in terms of a revamped toxin at the end of last year. What we've seen in the aesthetics market is that, of course, customers are going to try these new products. It's highly kind of newness driven and there's a novelty factor and trial and competitive trial is to be expected. And what we see is that these products and past aesthetic launches that we've watched, the share ramps for the first 12 to 18 months and then tends to stabilize. And so, of course, we don't underestimate any of our competitors. And so in 2023, we are modeling what we think is a competitive amount of share erosion in terms of our Botox business. And we'd expect that in '23 and beyond that U.S. BOTOX [ph] cosmetic will continue to be the clear number 1 market leader. And the new toxins that enter the market will be competing for their position number 2, 3 or 4 in our customers' offices.\\nJeff Stewart: And it's Jeff. On your comment on AMGEVITA, the range of pricings that were released were not really a surprise. There's been some external thoughts that this is of interest where there were 2 different AMGEVITAs, 1 high WACC and on low WACC. But again, we've seen this across very different categories and studied it very carefully, as you would expect. So we've seen variably priced WACC products in our own HCV market with authorized generics from competitors. We've seen it in the diabetes space across multiple competitors, including biosimilar competitors. And certainly, with the -- with Amgen and the other segments of their own business. They were often moving around the list prices as well. So all in all, within the range that we would expect from Amgen. Yes.\\nRob Michael: This is Rob. I'll take the question on net leverage. So the 2x is -- think about it as our sustainable target. So as long as there's a path back to net leverage of 2x, could take us in some cases, it could take 2 to 3 years to get back to that. But as long as there's a path, a very clear path to get back to net leverage of 2x, that's the best way to think about how we would evaluate it.\\nOperator: Our final question will come from Gavin Clark-Gartner with Evercore ISI.\\nGavin Clark-Gartner: Wanted to confirm if you were planning to submit the Imbruvica plus Venclexta frontline CLL combination to the FDA following the ASH this year? And then on 951 in Parkinson's, we saw top line data from competitors from last month. I don't have the full data yet. One thing that sticks out is that they have lower discontinuation rates. So just wondering if there's any insight on devices or trial design that may explain this.\\nRob Michael: It's Roopal. I'll take those. So for the ISV that you referenced, we have that in Europe and I think you're talking about the ASH data, overall survival. There as it clears couple of years is 0.5% or less and the PFS still stays low. At this time, we're not submitting here at the FDA. They would like to see a little more prospective data in another trial setting. So that's the hype. On 951, this is interesting on the competitors you bring up. So the when you run these patients in, you could have discontinuation rates. And if you include them or not include them, it's going to impact what happens post run in. So for example, when you see our data set, we count the run-in discontinuation and post run-in as you get into the main part of the trial. So you see that in the 20 percentile range or so. And that's fairly consistent with what you would see with a subcutaneous infusion. And it's not clear to us how that data, as you're speaking about is reported. Also, we don't know if that's more than 1 injection is that 2 injections and is it rotated daily. I can tell you about 951. We have dosing exposure that gets up to DUOPA unique from DUOPA to 24 hours. It's a single injection and you can leave it in for 72 hours.\\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Gavin. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for participating.

Tim Cook will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. Tim Cook: Thank you, Tejas, for joining us. We're always looking for new ways to empower people to create and collaborate. In December, we released Freeform, a brand-new app that lets users take their ideas wherever they want, anywhere they are, all while collaborating in real time. We set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion in services, which was better than what we had expected. We're proud to announce that we've achieved a truly incredible milestone. As Tim mentioned, revenue for the December quarter was $117.2 billion, down 5% from last year. A number of factors had a significant impact on our results. First, we faced a very difficult foreign exchange environment, which affected our performance by nearly 800 basis points. Third, the macroeconomic environment this past quarter was markedly more challenging than 12 months ago. Apple Pay is now available to millions of merchants in nearly 70 countries and regions. We saw a record-breaking number of purchases made using Apple Pay globally during the holiday shopping season. The growth is coming from every major product category and geographic segment, with strong double-digit increases in emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. We are seeing continued adoption of our Services for business like Apple Business Essentials, AppleCare, Tap to Pay and Apple Financial Services. Shannon, yes, I mean, we've had good margin for the December quarter to start with. In December, foreign exchange was a negative 110 basis points for us, and on a year-over-year basis, it's 300 basis points. We're doing a lot of work on the cost structure, and that is paying off, Shannon Cross says. Amit Daryanani: Services is a major focus of ours. It's incredible in terms of how it can enrich people's lives. He says we see opportunities to excel monetization abilities within the paid subscriber base. He says we're seeing that the level of engagement of our customers already in our ecosystem continues to grow. Luca Maestri, Luca Maestri, Luca Maestri, Luca Maestri, Luca Maestri, Luca Maestri, Luca Maestri, Luca Maestri, Luca Maestri, Luca Maestri, Luca Maestri, Luca Maestri, Luca Maestri, Luca Maestri,  Luca Maestri: We saw very good results in our cloud services business in payment services. Tim said that when you look at it in constant currency, we grew services double digits. Timothy Cook: The PC industry is expecting a decline in PC shipments this year also.\",\n          \"All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Please turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. This call is webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. In China, we renewed our partnership with ICBC, the largest bank in the world, in terms of assets and the biggest credit card issuer in China in terms of the number of cards. In Australia, we extended our credit and debit issuing agreements with NAV and CDA, two of the largest banks in the country. In the U.S., we recently renewed our relationship with Green Dot, a top 20 issuer in debit and a top 10 issuer in prepaid. In Europe alone, we have more We recently signed a deal with Finastra, one of the world's largest financial services software companies and open banking platforms. Together, we will offer Finastra's clients access to cross-border business, the small business at B2C payouts to eligible accounts in multiple currencies and countries. In Latin America, third quarter transactions quadrupled versus last year. We have over 20 domestic and cross-border P2P programs commercially launched or in pilot, such as PLIN and Yape in Peru, WhatsApp In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 36% above 2019 levels. In the US, credit grew 21% and improved 3 points to 38% over 2019, helped by travel and fuel spend. Debit grew 4% year-over-year, lapping the big spike from the stimulus last year. Relative to 2019, debit was up 55%, sustaining significantly above the pre-COVID trend line. Excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 35% due to strong growth outside the US. Client incentives were 26.1% of gross revenues below our expectations. This was driven by the faster-than-expected recovery of higher-yielding cross-border volumes, which improved revenue mix. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth. I don't see people being deterred even by higher cost of airline tickets that people are experiencing. Vasant Prabhu: There's a variety of factors at play here. You saw how much it improved this quarter, almost 20 points, if I remember right. Tien-Tsin Huang: Thanks so much. Great results. Very clear. The consumer is strong here. I'm thinking of this product credentials, acceptance, contactless or that would suggest more resilience. I think we're very different from any past recession, I guess, going back to 2008-2009 time frame. We're stronger in debit, which tends to be the vehicle, the card of choice for people in a slowdown period. Affluent spenders are returning to the economy and their higher spending in restaurants and travel. The impact of people working from home and hybrid work definitely continue to have impact on smaller tickets. We don't know what level of substitutions are taking place, and we're kind of lapping that now. As I said earlier, I think, Don, clearly, inflation is in our numbers. We're continuing to do two things: one is to make sure that we're smartly investing in the future to drive our three growth levers. At this point, we're being very vigilant in looking into the numbers and seeing if we see anything that requires us to be proactive in any action that we might take. We don't have the same input costs and COGS as other businesses, he says.\",\n          \"Liz Shea, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, joins us for the Q&A call. Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Rob Michael, Vice Chairman and President, Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Global revenues this quarter were nearly $1.6 billion, up 12.8% on a sequential basis. In psoriasis, SKYRIZI's total prescription share of the U.S. biologic psoriasis market has increased to more than 28%. In atopic dermatitis, RINVOQ is demonstrating strong uptake in both treatment naive and second-line patients globally. In the U.S. we began to see a slowdown in aesthetic procedures in the second quarter of last year. These trends continued through the end of the year with the most significant impact on higher priced more deferrable procedures, including fillers and body contouring. In the U.S. we began to see a slowdown in aesthetic procedures in the second quarter of last year. Results from these studies are expected to support regulatory submissions in the second half of the year for Venclexta and navitoclax in their respective indications. We also anticipate regulatory approval this year for epcoritamab in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma in several major geographies. Over the course of 2023, we expect to begin several new studies, including a Phase III study in frontline DLBCL in combination with R-CHOP and AbbVie's performance and financial foundation remains strong with our leadership positions across a diverse portfolio. Starting with fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.60 which is $0.07 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $15.1 billion, up 3.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 2.2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 52.1% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 86% of sales, adjusted R&D investment Terence Flynn: if you look at our productivity over the last 10 years, the data I've seen suggests we are 1 of the most productive R&D engines in the industry. We're coming into a phase as we move forward over the next 3 or 4 years, where we have a number of programs that if they are successful, they will create a scenario where we will increase R&D. We've seen some incredibly encouraging data out of that program thus far to next-generation immuno- if we significantly overachieved this plan into 2023, there's obviously somewhat somewhat greater risk it could move into '24. Rob Michael says we expect more of an impact in the second half of '23. He says the growth platform has the ability to grow through that based on those assumptions. He says that's the philosophy that we operate with on the guidance. Rob, anything you want to add on the first question and Carrie, maybe you can give a little more color. I think you characterized it well, Rick. We're not going to give you guidance but we're going to give you guidance. We're not going to give you guidance but we're going to give you guidance. Carter Gould: Maybe to come back to aesthetics. It does sound like you built in conservatism on a number of fronts. Carter Gould: Maybe to come back to aesthetics. It does sound like you built in conservatism on a number of fronts. But as we look at the year beginning in China, it does look like the current wave has peaked. Tim Anderson: I'm going to torch you with a couple more questions on the same subject as others. Tim Anderson: I think the way to think about it is in the first half of the year, the 27% in the first quarter, is the vast majority's price, second half of the year, you'll have some more volume kicking in. Rob Michael: I think the way to think about it is we would expect to see additional price but albeit not at the same level as '23. Tom Hudson: SKYRIZI and RINVOQ really raised the bar in terms of efficacy. So we're also going to read out head-to-head studies this year with STELARA and Otezla. We're hearing data of S1P1 inhibitors but the data appears to be less effective, he says. Jeff Stewart: We see some movement there, particularly in the, let's say, industry tax and I'll comment on the so-called VPaaS [ph] in the U.K. It didn't matter, frankly, whether we were in or not and the U.K. is a relatively modest business for us. Rick Gonzalez: We're seeing perhaps more importantly, some changes in the German law. Robyn Karnauskas: if you look at the STELARA dynamic with the biosimilar, you're going to see some level of pressure. He says there's a lot of cardio-tox [ph] in the space, so we look for where are the opportunities for us to bring in either an existing mechanism or something that we can either develop within our own discovery group or something that we can acquire on the outside as a mechanism that we don't currently have. He says that's I think it's a much better to take an oral than a cream when you actually have significant body coverage. I think it's a different -- it's a much better to take an oral than a cream when you actually have significant body coverage. I think it's a different -- it's a much better to take an oral than a cream when you actually have significant body coverage. In 2023, we are modeling what we think is a competitive amount of share erosion in terms of our Botox business. We've seen variably priced WACC products in our own HCV market with authorized generics from competitors. We've seen it in the diabetes space across multiple competitors, including biosimilar competitors.

Today\\u2019s call is being recorded. First quarter 2022 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company\\u2019s website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today\\u2019s earnings release. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Dan Glaser: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is John Doyle, our Group President and COO; Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses: Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan started 2022 strong, and we are well-positioned for another good year. Our top line momentum continued. We generated the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying growth and the highest first quarter underlying growth in over two decades, with each of our businesses showing strength. Our adjusted operating income grew 12%. This comes despite a tough comparable of 20% growth in the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted EPS growth was 16%, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And we saw modest margin expansion despite the substantial investments we made in organic hiring last year. Overall, a strong start to the year. At Marsh McLennan, advancing good in the world is important to us. In our view, great company have to not only do well and deliver for investors, but also do good and make a broader contribution to society. We believe in order to deliver long-term value for shareholders, we also have to be a good employer, a good global citizen, and bring our best to our clients. We are proud of our track record on ESG and recently released our second Environmental, Social and Governance report. Our report highlights the many ways in which we are confronting the most complex ESG challenges of our time, both within our own company and on behalf of clients. We made progress on several ESG initiatives. For example, we are committed to energy transition and achieve the carbon neutral certification in 2021. We also declared a new goal of being net-zero by 2050, with a target of reducing carbon emissions 50% by 2030. We are committed to inclusion and diversity. We launched our inclusion and diversity center of excellence and enhanced our D&I disclosure in the areas of pay equity, workforce representation and talent flows. And we added Gaye Erkan to our Board of Directors, furthering our commitment to increased gender diversity on our Board. We are also working across our businesses to help clients address the broad spectrum of complex ESG issues, such as climate change, diversity and inclusion, affordable healthcare, cybersecurity, and sustainable investing, among others. I want to highlight several recent examples of how we are developing ESG solutions for clients. Marsh launched the new directors and officers liability insurance initiative that recognize -- recognizes U.S. based clients with superior ESG frameworks. Guy Carpenter arranged FloodSmart Re catastrophe bonds for FEMA to secure capital markets based flood reinsurance coverage for its NFIP program. These bonds help FEMA pay for NFIP claims when disaster strikes. Mercer continues to be a leader in helping firms quantify and address pay equity, as well as diversity and inclusion challenges. As an example, our recently released stepping up for equity study provides insights on closing the opportunity gap for Black Americans. Oliver Wyman helped clients pursue commercially viable climate transitions, working with CDP, the World Economic Forum, the United Nations, and others to set agendas and build consensus on the issue of climate change. We are also helping clients develop low-carbon business models and manage risks associated with the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. As we do our part to accelerate this transition, we recognize that a secure energy supply is crucial for the global economy and society as a whole. This is especially true in the context of today's geopolitical environment. We believe all communities are best served by working with both operators of clean energy assets and traditional energy companies to make the transition as quickly and smooth as possible. The work we are doing across all of these ESG related areas has a direct impact on the communities where we live and operate. We are making a difference through disaster mitigation and recovery, promoting healthy societies, and diversity and inclusion. Overall, ESG continues to be an area where we see both significant growth potential, and an opportunity to benefit our clients, colleagues, and communities. I'd like to take a moment to comment on the war in Ukraine. We strongly condemn the Russian government invasion of Ukraine and are horrified by the tragic human toll this war is taking. On March 10th, we announced the decision to exit our business in Russia. In a minute, John will provide more detail on steps we've taken to support colleagues and serve our clients during this crisis. Turning to current economic conditions and the outlook for the rest of 2022. We see a picture with greater risks and uncertainties than when we enter the year. That said, we continue to see an environment that is supportive of growth. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect mid single digit or better underlying revenue growth for the full year. We also expect solid growth in adjusted EPS and to extend our track record of annual margin expansion. Macro challenges like supply chain per pressures, energy market and commodity dislocations, rising cybersecurity concerns, and future of work, create demand for our services and opportunities to help clients. We also believe that over the long-term demand for our solutions will remain strong, given rising levels of complexity, volatility, and uncertainty across the business landscape. With that, let me turn it over to John for his comments on the quarter. John Doyle: Thanks Dan and good morning everyone. Our first quarter results were strong. We had double-digit underlying revenue growth with all businesses positively contributing, and our adjusted operating in income hit a record level in the first quarter. Our strong star positions as well for 2022, despite greater uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook. Before I discuss market trends and our performance, I want to comment on our response to the crisis in Ukraine. As Dan noted, we condemned the Russian aggression and we are saddened by the human suffering the war in Ukraine has caused. Our primary concern is the wellbeing of colleagues affected by this crisis. We took a number of steps to assist them, including providing evacuation support for Ukrainian colleagues and creating assistance programs in Poland and Ukraine. In addition, we've established a humanitarian relief fund to help the Ukrainian people.  We're also bringing our capabilities and risk strategy and people to support clients as they grapple with the challenges of this conflict and its wider economic effects. Oliver Wyman is helping clients in the public and private sectors manage a wide scope of issues. We are working on government security in defense matters, helping a number of banks manage their exposure to the region, supporting energy clients with their supply chain considerations and assisting large manufacturers as they manage the risk of production shutdowns. Marsh is advising clients on risks around aircraft nationalization, cybersecurity, physical assets, supply chain, and transitioning away from Russian energy. Mercer is helping clients deal with capital market volatility, asset allocation and Russian exposures. We're also working to provide continued health coverage for Ukrainians leaving the country. Guy Carpenter is helping clients understand their exposures, portfolio concentrations and reinsurance recoveries. We're also advising clients on the complexities around sanctions and cause of loss, number of occurrences and claims aggregation. I'm extremely proud of how our firm has responded to this crisis. Overall, we are harnessing the power of Marsh McLennan to help our colleagues and our clients in this moment that matters. Now, let me provide an update on current P&C insurance market conditions. Rate increases in the marketplace continue to persist, reflecting losses and concerns about the impact of inflation on claims and the firm reinsurance market. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 11% year-over-year. This marks the 18th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. Looking at pricing by line. The Marsh Market Index showed global property insurance was up 7% and global casualty rates were up mid single digits on average. Global financial and professional lines, excluding cyber, increased high single digits, while cyber rates more than doubled in some geographies. As a reminder, our index skews the large account business, however, small and middle market insurance rates continue to arise as well, although less than for large complex accounts. Turning to reinsurance April 1 renewals largely reflected a continuation of the January 1 pricing environment. The industry remains well capitalized, but finding capacity is challenging in specific segments. This reflects ongoing and emerging issues such as the frequency of severe events, cyber, climate change, and core and social inflation. Overall, at April 1, U.S. property catastrophe rates were up in the high single digits for non-loss impacted accounts. While loss impacted accounts generally increased in a range of 10% to 30%. U.S. cyber rates were up mid teens or higher depending on loss activity. Japanese property catastrophe rates increased low single digits. We remain focused on helping clients navigate challenging insurance and reinsurance markets, and the evolving risk environment. Turning to our performance in the quarter. As I noted earlier, Marsh McLennan had strong results. In the first quarter, we had double-digit underlying revenue growth in both RIS and consulting. Adjusted operating income grew 12% on top of 20% in the first quarter of 2021, a terrific result. The first quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying revenue growth, a longest stretch in over two decades. Looking at risk and insurance services. First quarter revenue was $3.5 billion, up 10% compared with a year ago or 11% on an underlying basis. This is the third quarter in the last 12 months risk and insurance grew 10% or better, the best trend since 2003. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $1.2 billion, while our adjusted operating margin declined 10 basis points to 36.5% reflecting investments in the business. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, up 10% compared with a year ago. Revenue growth was 11% on an underlying basis. We had excellent renewal growth and we continue to see strong new business. U.S. and Canada had 10% underlying revenue growth. This marks the U.S. and Canada's fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying revenue growth. International was also strong with underlying revenue growth of 11%. Asia-Pacific was up 17%. LATIN America grew 16% and EMEA was up 9%. Guy Carpenter's first quarter revenue was $1 billion up 11% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth in new business and exceptional retention. Guy Carpenter has now achieved underlying revenue growth of over 10% three of the last four quarters. In the Consulting segment, revenue of $2 billion was a first quarter record, up 7% from a year ago or 10% on an underlying basis. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 10% or higher growth. Adjusted operating increased 9% to a first quarter record of $402 million. The adjusted operating margin was 20.6%, up 10 basis points versus a year ago. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis, the fourth consecutive quarter of 6% or higher growth. Career grew 16% on an underlying basis. We continue to see robust demand for solutions linked to new ways of working, skills gaps, workforce transformation, and D&I issues like pay equity. Health underlying revenue growth was strong at 9% in the quarter, reflecting growth across all geographies. This quarter's results benefited from strong demand for our services, higher retention, rising employment and medical inflation. Wealth increased 2% on an underlying basis, reflecting modest growth in both investment management and defined benefits. Our assets under management were $388 billion at the end of the first quarter, down 7% sequentially as net inflows were more than offset by capital market declines. However, compared to the first quarter last year, AUM was up 2%. Oliver Wyman's momentum continued despite starting to lap tougher comparables to an outstanding 2021. Revenue in the first quarter was $667 million, an increase of 17% on an underlying basis. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and reflects continued strong demand across all geographies. Overall, I'm pleased with our excellent first quarter performance and it sets us up for a good year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for further detail on our financial results and a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2022. Mark McGivney: Thank you, John and good morning. As Dan, John mentioned our financial performance in the first quarter marked a strong start to the year. We saw another great quarter of double-digit underlying revenue growth, meaningful earnings growth, despite tough expense comparison. We generated GAAP EPS of $2.10 in the quarter and adjusted EPS of $2.30 up 16% from a year ago. Operating income was $1.4 billion. And adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, a first quarter record. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points in the first quarter to 29.7%, despite the impact of the significant organic investments we made last year. We remain excited about the benefits we expect from these investments, but they come with upfront costs we continue to absorb in the short term. The first quarter was also active -- an active quarter for capital management. We completed the highest quarterly level of share purchases since the third quarter of 2015. The pace of acquisition activity continues, with the recent announcement of our acquisition of Booz Allen Hamilton's MENA practice. And we announced an additional $5 billion share purchase authorization. John covered our business operating results. So, I'll cover some of the other aspects of our performance and outlook. Adjusted corporate expense was $60 million in the first quarter. Foreign exchange was a headwind of $0.04 to our adjusted EPS. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a modest headwind in the second quarter. Our other net benefit credit was $62 million in a quarter. For the full year 2022, we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $250 million. Investment income was $26 million in the first quarter on a GAAP basis or $17 million on an adjusted basis, and mainly reflects gains in our private equity portfolio. Interest expense in the first quarter was $110 million compared to $118 million in the first quarter of 2021, reflecting lower long-term debt balances. Based on our current forecast, we expect a similar level of interest expense in the second quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 23.1% compared with 24.3% in the first quarter of last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discreet items, the largest of which was the accounting for share based compensation similar to a year ago. Excluding discreet items are effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume an adjusted effective tax rate of around 25% for 2022. In the first quarter, we recorded a $52 million charge, which is mostly non-cash relating to our exit from Russia. This has been treated as a noteworthy item and excluded from adjusted results. We reached an agreement to transfer ownership of our Russian business to local management who will operate independently in the Russian market. This situation resulted in the deconsolidation of our business and an associated write-down of our carrying value. In terms of ongoing impact, revenues and operating income from Russia are not significant. Turning to capital management. Now balance sheet. We entered the quarter with total debt of $11.7 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity isn't until March of 2023. In the first quarter, we repurchase 3.2 million shares of our stock for $500 million, reflecting our strong financial position and outlook for cash generation. We continue to expect to deploy approximately the $4 billion of capital in 2022 across dividends, acquisitions and share purchases. The ultimate level of share purchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develop. As we've consistently said, we favor attractive acquisitions over share purchases, as we view high quality acquisitions as the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long-term. However, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generates meaningful returns for investors over time. And each year, we target raising our dividend and reducing our share count. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $772 million. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $813 million and included $272 million for dividends, $41 million for acquisitions and $500 million for share repurchases. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we see continued strong demand for our advice and solutions, even though we start to lap tougher growth comparisons in the second quarter. The investments we made in hiring last year will continue to be a headwind to expense in the first half, but as we get further into the third quarter, this becomes less of a drag. Also, we recognize there is a higher level of uncertainty and outlooks caused by the war in Ukraine and its potential impact on the global economy. Overall, our strong start leaves us well positioned for another good year in 2022. For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver mid single digit or higher underlying growth, solid growth in adjusted EPS and margin expansion. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call back to Dan. Dan Glaser: Thanks Mark. And operator, we're ready to go to Q&A. Operator: Certainly.  Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the organic growth, another double-digit growth quarter. So, it sounds like you guys are still expecting that the revenue benefit from the hires that you guys did last year is more something that we should think about coming in the future. Can you give us a sense if there was any benefit from those hires that positively impacted the Q1, and how we should think about the rest of the year? Or is this still more a benefit you expect in 2023 and beyond? Dan Glaser: Sure. Sure, Elyse and good morning. I'll take it to begin with and then I'll hand off to John to add some detail to it. There's many factors which are underpinning our growth. We are in fundamental growth markets. You look at the areas of risk, strategy and people, the demand is all on the rise, and we are the most strategically positioned company in the world as an adviser in those areas. So, I think that broadly, and fundamentally, we've got some competitive advantages, which are assisting growth and will continue to do so. The hiring strategy of last year has given us a mild benefit thus far, in particular on Guy Carpenter. But John, why don't you go into that in a little bit more detail? John Doyle: Sure, Dan. Elyse, as I noted earlier, we're very pleased with our start to the year. Growth was strong pretty much across the board and I think you're referring to strat hires in RIS. But I want to note the growth in consulting was quite strong in the quarter as well as we're seeing good demand for our services across the board. We're pleased with the start in terms of the strat hire impact. As Dan noted, the impact was a little bit more notable in Guy Carpenter at this point. But it will take some time for them to become really fully accretive to our revenue expectations. It's a two to three-year period. So, our focus is on onboarding them as successfully as possible, but so far so good. The quarter really creates some good momentum for us. Obviously, there's a macroeconomic uncertainty given the war, given rising rates, supply chain issues, inflation, although I'd note inflation is generally a good thing for us on capital markets volatility, but we're well-positioned. As I said earlier, there's strong demand for our services, and we expect a good strong year of growth. Elyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my follow-up on, within RIS, if I look at the other operating expenses on an adjusted basis, they look to be flat to down modestly versus last Q1, which represented a pretty tough comp. So, any color on the drivers of that, given that I would think T&E should have been higher there? And how should we think about the outlook for the other Op expenses over the balance of the year? Dan Glaser: Sure. I mean, similar to last year, the growth of expense was virtually all related to compensation and benefits. And so, we continue to manage our expenses as we've always done. And when we look at the start of this year, yeah, things like T&E are a bit higher than what they were and we would hope that, that would continue, because it would point to more of a return to a normal operating environment. However, our searches for efficiency never ends. Our goal -- and I think I've said it on previous calls in the past, I mean, a healthy comp and ben as a percentage of revenue is a good thing for our business, for a people business. But continued focus on reducing all other operating expenses, particularly as we grow the firm bigger and bigger and use our -- some of our scale advantages to get some economies is something that's a core of how we operate the firm. So, I don't think you're going to see a lot of growth in the all other expense category. In fact, over time, you'll see reductions there. Next question, please. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Bhullar with JP Morgan. Jimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. You spoke about this a little bit in your comments as well. But can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of just pricing in both the commercial market and in reinsurance. And it seems like the prices are still up, but the pace is slowing down. And what sort of pushback are you getting, if any, from your clients on the study increases? And what are some of the things that they're doing whether increasing retention or otherwise? Dan Glaser: It's a good question. John, do you want to take that? John Doyle: Sure. Jimmy, as I noted in my prepared remarks, the insurance and reinsurance markets remain pretty challenging for our clients. Having said that, rate increases are decelerating and in at least most insurance markets around the world. Cyber, of course, is the most notable exception. For us, though, there is a mitigating impact of that rate deceleration around inflation and values. But let me ask Martin and Dean to comment a bit. Martin, maybe you could start, offer a bit more color on what's happening in the insurance market? Martin South: Sure. Thank you, John. Well, as you noted, it's the 18th consecutive quarter of rate increases. So, clients are weary, that's the concern. But they decelerated as I noted in the -- the last call we had, they came down by two points in last quarter, another two points this quarter to -- land at 11%. Geographically, still as I noted last time, there's one outlier, which is Latin America, where they saw modest rate increases, but have been flatter during the rest of the cycle. By product across the board growth, casualty still strong at 4%, property up 7%. FinPro lines, which includes cyber, 26%. If you're stripping that out, that comes down and we're still seeing double-digit and doubling of rates in cyber, over 110% in the U.S. And the U.K. rates up 100%. So, there's a lot more concerned about that, but otherwise, as noted a mild deceleration. John Doyle: Thanks, Martin. Dean? Dean Klisura: Thank you, John. As John mentioned earlier, the April 1 renewal reflected a continuation of the January 1 pricing environment. But there's challenges in the reinsurance market in certain segments that are driving pricing up. Examples of that would be the property catastrophe market where aggregate capacity continues to be constrained in the trading environment. Parts of the cyber market, including aggregate capacity for excess of loss contracts is currently a challenge and we're seeing double-digit pricing in the cyber market. And then, I would refer to segments of the London specialty market that are really being impacted by the Russia/Ukraine war, including more terrorism, political violence, aviation and marine coverages, we're experiencing very challenging renewals for excess of loss contracts. And then certainly retrocession capacity, again, as capital has flowed out of the ILS market in Bermuda and London, aggregate capacity for retrocession coverage continues to be very expensive and a challenge for our clients. John Doyle: Thanks Dean. Just one quick last point, Jimmy. We continue to invest heavily in data and analytics, really help our clients navigate the market and make the trade-offs ever for them. So, it's a client-by-client outcome ultimately. Jimmy Bhullar: Okay. And if I could just ask one more on Russia. Is the -- the Russia directly, obviously, is a very small part of your business, Ukraine as well. But the full impact of the conflict in terms of any sort of collateral impacts or something, is that fully reflected in your results? Or is there something that would be a lag in future periods, because it sometimes takes clients time to react? And like, should we expect anything noticeable in 2Q from Russia? Dan Glaser: Yeah. There's no inherent buildup issues that we're aware of, but there are implications to this war -- this war in Ukraine that are yet to play out. And so, we don't know what those are. What's the impact on energy prices? What's the impact on GDP globally, in particular, in Europe? Is there a continuation of taking size, which creates more division in the world? And what's the impact on that basis in terms of the last 20 years globalization developments? And so, there's a lot of factors, Jimmy. And that's part of the uncertainty that we've all talked about. We're doing very well. In some ways, we thrive in periods of uncertainty and volatility, because our clients want to talk issues through and we're a company that they turn to on some of these issues. But in terms of headwinds that it could conceivably create, I think, it's going to play out for quite a while now. We'll just have to see how it goes. But we've demonstrated in many different periods of time, whether it's a global financial crisis, COVID, et cetera, that we are an extremely resilient organization. Jimmy Bhullar: Thank you. Dan Glaser: Next question, please.  Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Yaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning everybody. My first question, I guess, maybe continuing your last comment, Dan. Clearly, you have a very strong track record of posting expenses that are lower than revenues. But with the significant hires you had last year, if we do head into a recession this year, do you think that you can still achieve margin expansion? Dan Glaser: We're going to have margin expansion this year. And it will be our 15th year -- consecutive years of margin expansion. We run our business where every year our revenue growth will exceed our expense growth. And it's not every quarter, but it's most quarters and it's certainly every year. It's the way we approach the business. And we have a tremendous capability of managing that expense base in both good times and tough times. Some ways, managing your expense base in tough times is easier than managing your expense base in good times where everybody wants to do need in different things. So -- but ultimately, we're comfortable that we've got growth momentum, and that will continue based upon the industries that we serve. Yaron Kinar: Okay. And my second question is with the Fed hiking rates now, fiduciary income, I'm assuming it's going to move up. Do you expect to have that flow all to the bottom line? Or do you have some maybe additional investments that you'd see taking action on or taking advantage of the higher margin coming from fiduciary income? Dan Glaser: No. It's a good question. So, Mark, do you want to take that? Mark McGivney: Yeah. Yaron, good morning. That fiduciary interest income is certainly a source of upside for us and exactly how much and when -- when we see the benefit all depends on and when rates move. But the vast majority of that would just flow right through to the bottom line. In 2019, we had $105 million of interest income. Last year, it was $15 million and we've overcome that. These days, we're averaging about $10 million of fiduciary assets. So, if rates move across the world where our balances are, by 100 basis points, that's $100 million of upside. Yaron Kinar: Thank you. Dan Glaser: Next question, please. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on that if I can. Do clients push for -- pushback against the increases when fiduciary income is rising? Or are those being significantly separate? Dan Glaser: No. It's a good question. And I've been in the business for 40 years. Clients don't want to get involved in the paying the 27 underwriters who are on their account and some of those things are semiannual payments and some are even monthly or quarterly. It is an administrative complexity that clients have no interest in being part of. We take our fiduciary responsibilities very seriously. So, it's not like we can invest long on fiduciary assets. So, it's all the short end of the curve. But we would anticipate no pushback on getting some income -- some fiduciary income because the fact of the matter is, for a number of years, this has only been a one-way traffic in the direction of down. And so, there's been many years where we've done an awful lot of work around billings and payments in which there was very little or no compensation related to it. So, we're looking at this as a potentially large upside to us. Meyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. Second question. I was hoping you could frame, I guess, clients' willingness to spend on ESG? How has that been developing? And is there any difference based on client size? Dan Glaser: Yeah. No. It's a very good question. And in some ways, the addressable market for ESG has not yet been determined. It's going to go wide. It's getting larger every year. And fundamentally, I think that every company from private or public midsize or larger is going out to demonstrate that they're a good company. And they demonstrate that in a multitude of different ways, but to -- with tight labor markets, that's the kind of company that people want to work for. Clients want to be associated with companies who are doing good work in the world. But I think it's an interesting question. I'd like to go around the horn a little bit and John can talk about it. And then maybe Martine and Nick can address it a little bit, because they're seeing a lot of ESG benefit in their results. But John? John Doyle: Sure, Dan. Meyer, we're quite excited about our role here and the ability to impact clients and their future. And it's contributing positively to our growth now, but we're in the very early stages of what's possible here across all the businesses. Dan added some of the work that we're doing in his prepared remarks. But again, we're developing new solutions, new products and working with our clients every single day. We're part of the sustainable markets initiative overall as a company. So, we're excited about that. Nick, maybe I'll ask you to comment first. You're doing a lot of work, particularly around climate, around broader issues as well. Nick Studer: Yeah. John, thank you. Thank you, Meyer for the question. The  has been working, a great deal with companies across sectors to help plan for a smart climate transition along the lines that Dan described in his prepared comments. As you know, we largely work with the larger company, so I can't talk to the segmentation part of your question. But whether it's in financial services, supporting backhaul industry as they move to support their clients, or whether it's with some of the hard-to-abate sectors like steel, like some of the transportation sectors. We see an enormous amount of work on our climate and sustainability cracks more than doubled last year. It's as big as some of our significant industry practices already. John Doyle: Martine, maybe you could comment? Obviously, we see big demand in career services, but are also doing a lot of work in investments. Martine Ferland: No. Absolutely John, and thanks for the question Meyer. We've been pioneering in ESG for many, many years now. First and foremost, the transition to the low-carbon economy. So, the investors or clients who work with us in managing their assets, they want to understand the transition to a lower net-zero emission economy and also the impact of, for example, the  they're making and their exposure to Russia, which falls under for them, their ESG policies. So, we're helping them, look at this and the consequences on oil supply, the energy strategy, et cetera. So, there's high demand for research, for advice, for modeling of the risk that are associated with that and the rewards of various investment strategies. And as you mentioned, John, of course, in the diversity, equity and inclusion domain, that's another place where we've been very active. We have many studies that help clients bridge the gender gap or the race and ethnicity gap. We do workforce analytics, we do pay equity. We have clients that build diverse workforces. And that's been such a tough of mine agenda item for our clients in the last couple of years. We just issued, as we said in the opening remarks, a stepping up for equity study where we work with 50 clients to identify the techniques, the strategies that you can employ for employers to really help close the gap on opportunities for Black Americans. And there's a G in the ESG, and that's also been always on our agenda. When you think about the work we do for executive compensation, DB and DC, the pension fund governance advice, our OCIO business is very much depend on different governance model that gives agility and integrity to the investment. So, that's really top of mind of our clients and its business that's been growing really fast over the last few years. John Doyle: Thank you, Martine. What's happening at Marsh? Nick Studer: Thank you, John. As exciting things going on in Marsh, we feel that a resilience index to have start  to see their progress on that business. We're testing hypotheses on clients about how a positive score can impact on their loss cost going forward in an initial study on D&O rates as mentioned in your remarks. It's showing that claims can be dispensed earlier and a lower outcome as companies seem to be doing good. We're testing that hypothesis in other areas of the business, other casualty lines that offset social inflation. And property as well where companies are investing heavily in social, in pollution protection and so forth, will make an impact there. We feel that we're going to back that up with the data strategy that we have and make a positive for our clients as they look ahead, and it's a good work for us too. John Doyle: Terrific. Thank you. Dean, one last one? Dean Klisura: Thanks John. Obviously, climate change is a top priority for Guy Carpenter's clients and we're working very closely with them to support them in these efforts. Obviously, helping them understand physical risk to climate change across their portfolios, across the world, and we're doing a lot of modeling and analytics work there to help them support there. We're inviting them on regulatory requests that come in, that want us access climate. We do credit rating advisory. Lots of the questions about the impact on climate change. And last, John, I would mention structuring transitional reinsurance solutions to help kind of mitigate that exposure for our clients. John Doyle: Thanks Dean. Dan Glaser: Thanks. So, you can see, Meyer, we're all over the ESG space and expect it to underpin our growth in future years. Next question, please. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David Motemaden: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify a comment on the reductions in other G&A expenses over time. I guess, was that a comment for this year? Or is that over a medium term timeframe? And also just want to get a sense for what's driving that. Because I know in the past, Dan, you've spoken about the operational excellence program, which might be contributing. But I'm also wondering, are there any sort of other sort of like real estate optimization or any other cost save programs that you're implementing as a result of some of the changes that have been put in place due to COVID-19, and what that means for the workplace? Is that also a driver that's coming through in that comment as well? Dan Glaser: Yeah. It absolutely is, David. Ultimately, the way we run our business is -- one of the operative words that we use is more. We want to get better every year. We want to provide our clients with more capabilities with less internal costs. And so, our search for efficiency is a core part of this executive team's job and something that we're very focused on. And whether it's real estate, more purposeful travel and tech modernization, operational efficiency gains, the fact that we've got several new faces around the table and new faces come up with good ideas and fresh ideas. And there's lots of ways of running the business. And our goal over time is supporting our clients with a combination of really good comp and ben, because that makes us a strong company and helps us be an employer of choice in the industries that we operate. But always relentlessly going after all other expenses that have just fundamental aspects of running a multinational. So, this is a midterm and a long-term downward trend in our expense base in all other expenses. Next question -- or you have a follow-up, David? David Motemaden: Yeah. I do have a follow-up. That's helpful, Dan. I appreciate that. And you mentioned a lot of new faces around the table, which is obviously -- you guys have been prolific in hiring. I guess, I look at that $30 million of legal claims that you guys have incurred this quarter. I think it's around $90 million over the last five quarters. Is there a way to approximate how much revenues are coming with those just from some of the teams that you guys have hired? Is it $50 million? Is it $90 million? Is there just like a rule of thumb that we can think about for the potential revenue impact over the next few years as those people are onboarded? Dan Glaser: Yeah. I mean, I think, the way to look at it is, our revenue over the next several years should benefit from the organic hiring that we did last year. I mean, you look at it on the basis of -- last year, we had an opportunity to make significant organic investments in building our business. And it's something that we always focus on delivering good results today, but always focusing on the future and how we can build a better company. And this is an opportunity that John and I haven't seen in our careers in terms of being able to build the business on an organic basis. And so, we had the opportunity and we had the means, and last year's strong levels of organic growth helped provide those means and meant that we could still deliver good results to investors last year, while we were making these strong organic investments. You have to know that we all know around the table that organic investments are always short-term dilutive, and it's harder to do in some ways and acquisitions just by the P&L map, but we made the right decision and press forward. The vast majority of that expense is comp and ben. And the way I would look at it is we've got another two or three quarters and then the expense growth is going to be in the rearview mirror, but the capability and the growth kicker will remain. And so, this is a huge benefit to the overall organization. We're not going to quantify whether Henry and Sally are delivering today. I mean, we're a big organization. We've added to our market leading capabilities. We like where we are positioned right now in terms of the performance of some of that strategic hiring, and this is going to be a best with for us in coming years as well as this year. David Motemaden: Understood. Thank you. Dan Glaser: Sure. Next question, please. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith: Yeah. Thanks. A couple of quick questions here. First, maybe Mark, free cash flow this quarter was pretty weak and it looked like there was a lot of paid compensation. How much of that was called one-time in nature just from all the hires that you had last year? And kind of how do I think about free cash flow here going forward? Mark McGivney: Sure. Good morning, Brian. So, I'd start by saying, if you look back over a long stretch of time, our track record on free cash flow growth has been terrific. With the last decade, we've generated double-digit free cash flow growth. And you expect that given our strong earnings and our outlook is -- for continued strong earnings growth and continued strong free cash flow growth. If you look back over that last decade though, you'd see a lot of volatility and you see that volatility just in the last couple of years. So, we generally would stay away from talking about predicting free cash flow in a given year, although we expect strong cash generation this year. Now as you pointed out, first quarters typically are low for cash generation, because we do pay out the majority of our variable comp in the first quarter. And the reduction this year was because our variable comp payouts were up. And that was mostly a function of the strong performance we had last year, both on new business growth and sales related plans as well as just the overall growth in earnings and the bonus plans that accrue from that. Brian Meredith: Great. And then my next question, just curious perhaps you could talk a little bit about what the M&A kind of environment landscape looks like right now, given all of the uncertainties right now with respect to what economic growth could look like over the next 12 months and I wonder if you could comment on that. Dan Glaser: Sure. I'll start and then I'll hand to John. M&A is a big part of our organization and not just for the last decade, but literally since its inception. We don't have a budget around acquisitions. We're cautious when we make acquisitions. We like to cultivate relationships over long stretches of time. As has been commented in the marketplace before many times, over the last decade, multiples have risen. So, therefore, we're even more selective than we used to be and we're careful around pro formas, because most of the companies that we acquire are private. And we want to really understand the ongoing characteristics of the business and not some fancy dressed up pro forma statement. And so, the one thing that we're committed to is capital deployment. And so, we look at -- we favor share repurchase -- we favor acquisitions over share repurchase, but we certainly favor share repurchase over building more cash on the balance sheet. And so, we will utilize that circa $4 billion between the dividend, which is 7% and growing acquisitions and then share repurchase. But the M&A pipeline, ebbs and flows, it looks pretty good right now. But we don't really have -- we wouldn't at this stage to have a strong idea of where we would end up the year on that because many of the discussions we have are exclusive and the discussion is essentially the company decided whether they want to join forces with us or stay private. But John, do you want to talk about the pipeline, or how we're looking at M&A these days? John Doyle: Sure. Good morning, Brian. We did three small deals in the quarter, one at Oliver Wyman, in Australia, one at M&A here, of course, in the United States, and then we did one at Mercer Marsh Benefits in France. So, we remain very active in the market. The pipeline, as Dan noted, is pretty solid. Generally speaking, the pipeline is deepest in the middle market brokerage space, and that's typically where we see some of our best and most attractive opportunities. But I would point out, we've done some more at Oliver Wyman, a lot of work at Oliver Wyman of late, not just in the quarter, but in the later part of last year. You may have seen that we recently announced that we expect to close on Booz Allen Hamilton's Middle Eastern business sometime in the second quarter. So, we'll see how the market evolves. Part of the dynamic here is our reputation as a buyer is very strong in these markets. And so, we get a good look at very attractive assets. Brian Meredith: Thanks. Brian Meredith: Next question, please. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Just on EMEA within RIS, these results were particularly strong. Just curious if you could give us some color on sort of how demand and trading trends developed, I guess, as the quarter went on and as geopolitical a little more complicated? Dan Glaser: Sure. John? John Doyle: Sure. Sure, Ryan. Yeah. We're pleased with our start in EMEA. We had good growth in the U.K. As we've shared in the past, for Continental Europe, the first quarter is a big part of the overall year. So, we're pleased to get off to a strong start. I think the one area that was probably notable on the RIS side is the impact of capital markets, the slowdown in M&A, the slowdown in IPOs. We began to see a bit of an impact as the quarter went on. But overall, demand again for our services remains quite strong and we feel good about how we're positioned all over the world, but in EMEA, in particular. Ryan Tunis: Got it. And then, on the Mercer side, results were strong again there as well. Could you maybe just remind us, is there a seasonality to discretionary aspect of that? I wasn't sure if perhaps first quarter, there are more discretionary projects and maybe that's why it was outsized, so it's not even throughout the year. And also curious, I guess, for Martine, on the wealth side, with higher interest rates and choppier markets, what are the headwinds and tailwinds the debt produces? Dan Glaser: Are you sneaking in two questions? Ryan Tunis: I might have, Dan. Sorry. Dan Glaser: Thanks. Martine? Martine Ferland: Yeah. Thank you, Ryan. Well, first, you asked about discretionary project, and I would say, no. This is not -- there's no cycle to this. It's pretty much through the year. It's big project that clients work with us. And there's still lots of demand for these projects. So, of course, we always keep an eye on the outlook. In terms of potential recession, as we know, this is the discretionary projects are a little bit more sensitive to that than other parts of the business. But so far, so good. The demand is really strong. And we see the immediate, a very strong outlook for the year. And you just think about the solutions that we're solving through with our clients in the discretionary projects, whether they are the future of work or -- and there's a link here to your question on the volatility on the wealth business, because when there's uncertainty clients need us to do more modeling or more planning around the investments in the pension plan. So, the bottom line is it's not seasonal. And just to complete the thought on your question on the wealth side, of course, the capital markets have been creating some headwinds on the short-term basis or part of the business that's linked to our assets under management. We call it the outsourced Chief Investment Officer business, OCIO. It's a fantastic business. It's given us many, many years of strong growth. We have strong flows. But, of course, on the short-term, as this business grows in proportion to our portfolio, we will maybe see a little bit more volatility there, but we're able to manage that in the grand scheme of the firm. And we've done so this quarter, because it has been negatively impacted since the beginning of the year. The other thing -- the other end on this, and you've alluded to that in your question is the -- first of all, the AUM portfolio, our assets are diversified. So, there's some risk management in that equity fixed income alternatives. In the long run, it will grow. It's also that this business now is larger than our traditional DB business. And therefore, over the long run, we also see that as a tailwind. And the market volatilities just creates demand for stronger governance, better agility and moving assets from one to the next. And you'll see this as interest rates go up and the pension funding gets better. You'll see clients wanted to secure that and start shifting assets to fixed income and also provides them more opportunity to think of derisking that side of the business, which has been a trend for many years now. Ryan Tunis: Thank you. Dan Glaser: Perfect. Next question. Thanks. Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Joshua Shanker: You've been really generous with your time and we're at the end, so I'll be quick. Just one, easy one. Can we just talk about COVID in Asia-PAC right now? And what that means for the coming quarter and how you see that playing out? Dan Glaser: Sure. I mean, I think, we -- I used the resilience before, it's not just us. I think the world has gotten pretty resilient in that. We're not in 2020 anymore, and we've been able to adapt to different ways that have occurred in certain segments, whether that's in Europe, U.S., Asia, I mean, the one thing about COVID is no part of the world actually escaped. And so, we don't see a tremendous impact on our results from COVID. It would be more of a softer potential impact on just any headwind on GDP or business development. But other than that, we feel pretty good. I mean, you just look at Marsh's results as an example, in Asia-PAC in the quarter, it wasn't -- it's not COVID free. It was pretty active in Asia-PAC. So, in some ways, in terms of impact on our results, we think COVID is pretty much in the rearview mirror as well, knock wood. Joshua Shanker: Alright. Thank you. Dan Glaser: Thanks. Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan, for any closing remarks. Dan Glaser: So, thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter and a particular shout out to all of our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving our clients. So, thank you very much.\",\n          \"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Synopsys Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter of the Fiscal year 2021. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. If you should require assistance during the call, please. Press start followed by 0. Today's call will last one hour. 5 minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Lisa Ewbank: Thank you, Eric. Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining us. Speaking today, are Aart de Geus, Chairman, and Co-CEO of Synopsys, and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of the conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets, and other forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today. Our actual results are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release. In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion.  Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the earnings press release, financial supplement, and 8K that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call. With that, I will turn it over to Aart de Geus. Aart de Geus: Good afternoon. Synopsys continues to execute very well, delivering record revenue and non - GAAP earnings in the third quarter. Revenue was 1.057 billion with GAAP earnings per share of $1.27 and non - GAAP earnings of $1.81. We again made excellent progress on our margin expansion goals and generated 422 million of operating cash flow. Thanks to the hard work of our entire Synopsys team, on a TTM basis, we have surpassed the major milestone we set our sights on a few years ago, 4 billion in revenue and a 30% operating margin. Reflecting our strong year-to-date results, the vibrant markets we serve, and technology innovations driving custom momentum in all product groups and all geographies.  We are raising fiscal 2021 revenue, non - GAAP ops margin, earnings, and cash flow targets. We are well on the way towards our next goal of crossing 5 billion in revenue by 2023, raising our long-term revenue objective to double-digit growth with continued margin expansion. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail. Meanwhile, the market is not only strong, but it is also transforming in a way that is very positive for Synopsys, both consumer and business demand for Smart Everything continued to intensify and rolled. Smart devices intersect many skills and technologies. Massive amounts of data are to be stored, transmitted, and processed.  Sophisticated machine learning and application software are specific to each market segment. In these megatrends, semiconductors are absolutely critical. This means not just more chips, but more advanced chips, lower-power chips, and chips that can be abutted or stacked for tight implementations. In addition, security and safety are rapidly becoming must-haves, integrating more and more system requirements. To make Smart Everything possible, companies need more automation while transforming the way they approach the development of their systems. New entrants such as large hyper scalers, increasingly designed their own specialized chips and our business with them are growing rapidly.  Other Systems Companies, such as automotive, increasingly exert heavy influence on their suppliers by specific -- specifying key elements of [Indiscernible] performance as well as functional safety and security. Synopsys is a crucial enabler and the broad economic pool is now augmented, augmenting the traditional Moore's Law push, thus driving more opportunity for us. Synopsys is ideally suited to capitalize on these tailwinds. Over the past five years plus, we've invested heavily in breakthrough innovations that are now driving excellent customer results, and with it, accelerated business growth.  Let me highlight 3 areas. AI and autonomous design, Silicon IP, and security. Let's start with AI. Designing today's most advanced chips with the additional vertical market requirements is among the most difficult engineering tasks, period. As schedule pressured, designers reached the practical limits of human design efforts. We must use the power of AI to automate, not just design tasks, but the entire segments of the design flow. This is exactly what's Synopsys pioneered a year and a half ago. AI-driven autonomous design. Sitting on top of our Fusion Design Platform, we have built an AI solution that automatically explores, implements, and optimizes multi-month design efforts in a matter of a week.  Called DSO.ai, which stands for design space optimization using AI, the system has been used by customers on real chips, gone through production tape-outs, and seen silicon back for manufacturing. DSO.ai is a breakthrough technology. The results are great. Through this, we've already achieved important customer renewals. Not only does it literally reduced design times from month to weeks, but it also improves performance, power, and area substantially beyond what our teams of experts achieved on their own. In addition to early industry recognition, as it won a 2020 world electronics Achievement Award for innovative product of the year. Customer engagements have been exceptional with early endorsements by Samsung and our NSR.  In addition, this quarter, a large Asia-Pacific provider or events chips achieved with one engineer in one month were previously acquired Several experts over 3 months of manual work. One high-profile use customer using DSO.ai attained a better quality of results through a remarkable 20% reduction in power consumption. Next Monday, our keynotes, the [Indiscernible] Conference, reporting on further great DSR advances and another exciting customer success. The impact of this AI brain is greatly leveraged by the powerful system that sits on top of our Fusion Design Platform. We were tiny at the fusion concept several years ago by literally fusing together critical segments of the design flow into a single platform.  The outcome best-in-class results in terms of chip speed, power, and area. Today, fusion compiler is the only solution available that seamlessly integrates market-leading synthesis, place, and route with timing, power, and physical sign of all into a single tool. It's the fastest ramping new design solution in Synopsys ' history, already surpassing 500 tape-outs across multiple verticals, including AI, 5G, and high-performance computing for process nodes from 40-nanometer down to 3-nanometer. Notably, our leading foundry partners are already actively leveraging Fusion Compiler towards 2-nanometer enablement. Our Fusion Design Platform is relied on by the world's largest influential and hard-driving Companies.  Production successes include advanced tape-out by Samsung Foundry for its next-generation chip and [Indiscernible] nanometer gate-all-around technology. In parallel to autonomous design. Another way to reduce risk and speed time-to-market for complex chips is by using a ready-made IP. Our broad market-leading IP portfolio is delivering excellent double-digit growth towards what will be another outstanding year. Demand is very strong with customers substantially expanding their reliance on us and renewing multi-year commitments faster than ever before. High-performance compute, automotive, and mobile markets are especially strong. One thing, both more and more advanced IP.  Let me highlight three areas. First, with growth in cloud data, we're seeing high demand for faster high-performance interfaces, such as DDR5, PCI Express 5.0 and 6.0, and 800 gig Ethernet. We saw great momentum this quarter with multiple customers selecting our first-to-market, next-generation PCI Express 6.0 IP for advanced high-performance computer chips. This is a testament to the success of our PCI Express 5.0 IP, which has nearly 200 design wins. This Quarter. we also saw immediate traction for our 400-800 gig Ethernet IP solution through multiple designs wins that include our 112-gig studies.  Second, the number of highly advanced chip designs across Cloud, AI, and 5G applications has been growing rapidly. Our large and experienced R&D team remains at the forefront of delivering highly differentiated IP at the cutting edge of technology. In 5-nanometer, we've secured nearly 400 design-ins across 33 customers. And this quarter, a significant driver of our physical IP business came from 5, 4, and 3 nanometers. Lastly, we're also seeing our customers integrating more security capabilities into their chips. This is driving excellent momentum with our security IP Portfolio, including strong demand for, IDEIP to secure PCI Express and CXEL interfaces. Which is a natural segway to software integrity.  We're doing well with increasing momentum following the significant execution and operational improvements we've made. In fact, Q3 was our highest order Quarter ever, and we expect to eclipse our original revenue goal for the year. As Matt said, ongoing security threats to business safety and health have become almost commonplace. Companies are rethinking their protection strategies. It's no longer effective to pick and choose points tools with partial capabilities. Protection now requires a holistic, strategic approach. Synopsys is at the forefront of this evolution with the industry's only portfolio that features the broadest set of application testing solutions.  Strategic Consulting to assist executives and boards in charting their software security plan. And now an innovative offering that elevates the impact of the Polaris platform. With the recent introduction of Intelligent Orchestration, our Polaris platform can seamlessly integrate and automate security testing within each Company's protocol. We took another significant step in Q3 with the acquisition of Code Dx. They are the leading provider of application security risk management products that automate and accelerate the discovery, prioritization, and remediation of software vulnerabilities. This combination elevates our capabilities beyond what competitors can provide, a comprehensive, easy to adopt, holistic solution.  On the go-to-market side, we see very good progress from the enhancements we've made. Our services business again did better than a plan with over 20 new logo wins in North America alone. Our win and renewal rates continue to improve. and we are encouraged by the progress we have made. Industry Analysts continue to recognize the strengths of our strategy and Portfolio. For the fifth year in a row. Synopsys was named a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing. And today we were again recognized as a leader in the Forrester Wave for software composition analysis.  So far, I've highlighted 3 major areas, AI, IP, and security. Let me point out a couple of other innovations that enable this new era. One of Synopsys ' strengths is focused on the intersection of hardware and software, which is inherently crucial in Smart Everything. Our hardware-based verification systems continued to generate very strong business with year-to-year -- year-to-date, 36 new logos, and about 150 repeat orders. In addition, with innovation spending both emulation, FPGA -based prototyping, we're off to a solid start to a multiyear product upgrade cycle. Over the last two quarters, we introduced new application-specific emulation products.  The ZeBu Empower System enables early power analysis to reduce power-related risks. And the ZeBu EP1 is the first of its kind, high-performance computing for mobile GPU, CPU, and AI Design. Both are substantially faster with higher capacity than any competitive solution in the market today. And we are already seeing strong demand and deployments as large, influential customers around the world. Q3 was our largest orders quarter ever for our HAPS prototyping product line, fueled by the new HAPS-100. With the highest performance and unmatched enterprise scalability, we closed multiple competitive wins in the Quarter. With the momentum in both emulation and prototyping, we expect another record revenue year extending our market and technology leadership.  With increasing chip and system complexity, growing reliability requirements are now demanding ongoing post-silicon analysis, maintenance, and optimization. Our new Silicon lifecycle management platform leverages our leadership in both EDA and IP as it monitors analyses, and optimizes chips, from design to manufacturing, to in-field adjustments. This innovative approach opens up substantial new TAM for us, with business ramping ahead of expectations. Even at this early stage, we achieved 2 large expanded renewals this quarter.  In summary, Q3 results were excellent and we are raising our full-year objectives substantially. Vibrant markets, compelling innovations, and strong execution positioned us to continue to increase Shareholder and value going forward. While we will provide specific long-term objectives next quarter, we aim to cross 5 billion in revenue by 2023. We are raising our annual revenue growth objectives to double-digits with continued margin expansion. These results are not possible without our global team through the pandemic, they have demonstrated commitment, resilience, and compassion for others while executing very well. Lastly, I hope you and your families are vaccinated, healthy, and staying safe. With that, I'll return it over to Trac. Trac Pham: Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. Third-quarter results, including record revenue and non - GAAP earnings reflect strong momentum across the Company. For the full year, we are on track to deliver mid-teens revenue growth. An increase in non - GAAP Opening Margin of more than 200 Basis points, non - GAAP Earnings per share growth of more than 20%, and approximately 1.35 billion in operating cash flow. The combination of the dynamic markets we serve, the powerful impact of our products and solutions on customer results. And our history of strong execution is the basis for our setting the goal of crossing 5 billion in revenue by 2023. Now to the third-quarter results.  All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. We generated total revenue of 1.057 billion up 10% driven by broad-based strength across all product groups and geographies. Semiconductor & System Design segment revenue was 959 million with solid growth in both EDA and IP. Software integrity segment revenue was 98 million and we are executing better than expected against our bookings plan for the year. As a result, we project that software integrity revenue Growth will approach double-digits for the full year. And we are solidly on the path to accelerate revenue growth to the 15% to 20% range long-term.  Moving on to expenses, total GAAP costs and expenses were 865 million, which includes approximately 15 million in restructuring costs. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were 720 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 31.9%. We are on track to deliver operating margin expansion to approximately 30.5% for the year. The adjusted operating margin for the semiconductor system design segment was 34% and the Software Integrity margin was 9%. Wrapping up the income statement, GAAP earnings per share were $1.27. non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.81. Turning to cash, we generated 422 million in operating cash flow. We recently completed a $175 million stock buyback, bringing the total to the fiscal year to 573 million.  We ended the quarter with a cash balance of 1.53 billion with total debt of 107 million. For fiscal 2021, we are raising our revenue and non - GAAP operating margin, and earnings guidance. Our targets are revenue of 4.19 to 4.22 billion, an increase of 145 million at the midpoint, representing mid-teens growth. Total GAAP costs and expenses between 3.431 and 3.459 billion. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between 2.915 and 2.925 5 billion, a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30.5%.  Other income and expenses, which are minus six and minus 4 million, the non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%, GAAP earnings of $4.63 to $4.79 per share. Non - GAAP earnings of $6.78 to $6.83 per share, representing over 20% growth. Cash flow from operations of approximately 1.35 billion and capital expenditures of approximately 90 million. Now to targets for the fourth quarter, revenue between 1.138 and 1.168 billion. Total GAAP costs and expenses between 924 and 952 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between 805815 million GAAP earnings of $1.09-$1.25 per share. And non-GAAP earnings of $1.75. To $1.80 per share. We will provide detailed 2020 guidance and our updated long-term financial objectives and assumptions will report next quarter. As part of that discussion. we will also provide an update of our three-year normalized non-GAAP tax rate, which is under review. Although we have not completed the assessment, I want to highlight that the rate may increase in light of the assumptions under review. In conclusion, we delivered record revenue and non-GAAP earnings as strong operating cash flow.  Based on our excellent results year-to-date, and our outlook for Q4, we are substantially raising our targets for the full year and setting the goal of crossing 5 billion in revenue by 2023. This reflects an increase in our long-term revenue growth objectives to double-digits and is also complemented by ongoing margin expansion. At the same time, we will continue to invest to further scale the business and drive an increase in Shareholder value going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to the Operator for questions. Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish [Operator Instructions]. For the Q&A session, I would like to ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question and one follow-up, to allow us to accommodate all participants. If you have additional questions, please reenter the queue, and will take as many as time permits.  Once again, if you have a question, please press 1 then 0 at Instructions] One moment, please for the first question. And the first question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink, he's with Baird. Please go ahead. Joe Vruwink: Oh good. Hi, everyone. I wanted to start on just kind of the recalibrated revenue growth framework. Can you maybe discuss some of the ways the composition of the growth profile is different than it has been in the past? You spent a lot of time and prepared remarks highlighting new products, is vitality better today than it maybe was in the past, or is this a huge wave of domain-specific application-specific development? Is that just a magnitude proving to be much greater than it has been in the past? Aart de Geus: Thanks for the question. It's a bit all of that. I think that Sinatra's is a high degree of vitality right now, largely as a result of many years of complex investments that certainly are intersecting in a positive way. And so, you may recall the many times we talked about a Fusion Compiler for example, as a sort of AI Platform to do a very advanced design with.  Well, once you intersect that with the ability to automate some of that with other words put a sort of a brain on top of it, that brain if it functions well can do a lot because the fusion compiler is a very, very powerful tool. And so, all of these efforts took many years to get to this point.  And now they are showing results. And what is powerful about showing results is you learn very quickly from the results to get better results and improve. And so, this is moving forward very rapidly. Simultaneously, you opened up a very good comment, which is that a number of efforts become, maybe not entirely domain-specific, but certainly more domain sensitive.  And so, when you talk about automotive or industrial, or other areas that require a certain degree of security and safety, well, those are additional demands that come in. And in general, if you buy into my picture of saying, hey, the whole world is heading towards Smart Everything, well, all the Smarts is applied in those verticals in different ways.  And so, some have a lot of data, others have very difficult data to deal with, and others just require instantaneous fast computing. Those are all a bit different. And so yes, there will be an increase for gradual specializations in the vertical markets. But at the same time, you can only do that if you have an extremely strong and capable foundation. And I think we are certainly in a good spot for that. Joe Vruwink: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then maybe just more of a near-term focus question, the guidance for the fourth-quarter does imply a pretty big step-up just relative to where the implied guidance was last quarter. I'd imagine you touched on the strength of the hardware. I would assume that's a contributor. Can you just talk about the expected performance of the software business into the fourth quarter and I'll leave it there? Thank you. Trac Pham: Now, let me take that one, Joe, the sort of core fourth-quarter really flex continuing strength across all the businesses. We consider ramp up software, hardware better than expected, and the same with IP. and then we are also seeing a progression on the software integrity business as well. So, it's coming from all areas of the business. Joe Vruwink: Okay. Great. Thank you very much... Trac Pham: You're welcome. Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jackson Ader: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on DSO.ai. I'm just curious, can we get a little bit more color on maybe, how this is priced on a per-seat basis, and whether -- is it only available to those customers on better on the Fusion Compiler platform, or is it also available elsewhere? Aart de Geus: Well, it's a bit of a complicated question because we are in the first wave of making them successful. And suddenly we have built one of its capabilities on Fusion Compiler. And since we have pretty much all of the events, customers using Fusion Compiler, we have plenty of opportunities. to continue with that.  And there's a lot of runways in terms of what we can accomplish. What I did not mention is that DSO.ai is actually a capability that can also be applied in other domains. And over time, we will use some of that technology and the ability to design better silicon technologies, for example, or in the clarification space.  So, there are many directions that we can take with that. And we are strongly engaged now with some of the most advanced design teams in the world. And maybe the only comment I want to make right now on pricing and so on is that it has already helped us see some growth in renewals. And that is really the direction that we count on for technology that truly has a big impact on our customers. Jackson Ader: Okay, great. And then to follow up on the regions. Is there just a kind of second, third quarter on a rather than China had the same, big sequential jump and I'm just curious whether if there's a distinct seasonal purchasing pattern in China that might be different from the other regions that you, see? Aart de Geus: To be honest, I think for the last 15 years, I've said we have never had really a seasonable pattern. It is just one continuous wave. And when a certain region is not as big as another, it is more often than not just the fact that the renewals at that time are different than in other regions.  Now commenting specifically about China, the very, very good results and continued good results are due to a very broad adoption so -- by many companies and, of course, many companies that themselves are investing heavily in the future and driving business very hard. It's just a very active region and expect that to continue. Jackson Ader: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson, Please go ahead. Tom Diffely: Yes. Good afternoon and thanks for the question. Trac, I was hoping you could give me a little bit more about your view on operating leverage going forward, and what do you see as the key drivers, be it segments or product mix or moving to a hybrid office model, whatever you think is important. Trac Pham: I think all those things that you touched on John will [Indiscernible] will help the operating leverage. But really the two biggest ones are continuing to grow, Growth revenues and in fact, we're raising the outlook for revenue growth. Secondly, the things that really move the needle are investments in the business and making sure that we're investing in the areas that are going to give us the biggest returns.  You are also seeing strong results in the growth and revenues for this year because of changes and improvements that we've made on the go-to-market side, both on the semi and the six side. Software [Indiscernible] side. Those big drivers, as well as a ton of work across the Company in so many different areas, including the items that you mentioned, are what is going to help us continue to drive operating margins up over the next several years. Tom Diffley: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then Aart, I was hoping you could give us a little bit more about the competitive landscape in the IP market and what you're seeing from a pricing point of view or just an overall competition point of view. Aart de Geus: Well, I think we continue to outperform well others because of both the breadth and the complexity of our platform. I want to say, though ARM is also doing very, very well. And we are sort of almost 100% complementary to what they do.  And so, what I think we see is, A, that there are many more designs that there especially much more complex designs. And that second comment is important because the value and the cost, but also the necessity for very advanced nodes is, has increased. And so, we observed that in multiple ways, and of course, by what's our customer's order.  But also, at the speed with which they absorb it. And in some of the numbers I gave in the preamble, you could see that a significant portion of our business is already at 5, 4, and 3 nanometers. And these are invariably extremely sophisticated customers that need large, complex blocks and do a lot of design. So, in general for us, the market is doing extremely well and IP has definitely been a shining star at Synopsys for a number of quarters now. Tom Diffely: Have you seen pricing strength [Indiscernible] along the way? Aart de Geus: I don't think that that has changed. The more complex things are more expenses and customers expect that. But fundamentally, it's a business of almost constant renewals. And I think we must be okay with our pricing because our customers consume what they buy often faster than the timeframe that they allocated and then they renew. And a lot of this business is built on the trust that we will deliver something that they can count on at the right time. And so, a lot of it is very sophisticated repeat business. Tom Diffely: All right. Thank you. Aart de Geus: You're welcome. Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo, please go ahead. Gary Mobley: Hey, everybody. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Since you guys mentioned it in your prepared remarks and your press release, I, hopefully, you can give us some additional color on your long-term view of revenue, $5 billion in the Fiscal year 23. You can get to double-digit percent Company on your growth depending on what your starting point is. If it's fiscal year 20, you can get there. But are we talking about double-digit percent growth on average for the next 2 years? In other words, is this a preliminary view of double-digit percentage revenue growth for the next fiscal year? Trac Pham: Well, I want to be careful like getting into the details on next year, but the mask over the next couple of years really is off of the current guidance for '21, Gary. Gary Mobley: Got you. That makes it very clear then, very bullish. And then I'm surprised it hasn't been asked yet, but you're raising the implied fourth-quarter revenue guide or from the previous implied I guess I should say, by 11%, that's obviously perhaps supported by some stronger backlog. So, my question is, what is the backlog? Can you share that with the 10-K filing? Trac Pham: Certainly the -- when we file the Q at the backlog, you'll see is 4.7 billion. And as we've -- we've cautioned, you and others on the past backlog, while it's a big number, will move from quarter-to-quarter by depending on what gets renewed and what gets recognized as revenue.  I think this Quarter is very emphatic supportive that we can raise the year by 135 million at the midpoint and see backlog move the other way. So overall, really the guidance and the outlook for the year as a reflection of the strong growth in the deals that we are booking and our confidence in our ability to continue to drive that too strong renewals. Gary Mobley: Alright, great. Thank you, guys. Trac Pham: You're Welcome. Operator: And the next question, comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities, please go ahead. Jay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good evening. With regard to that very interesting target now for 2023, a couple of things. Internally, how are you thinking about any structural or capacity, or operational changes that you might need to put in place with specter let's say R& D or go-to-market? Similarly, you have one customer that is known as a matter of public record, is fairly consistently over 10% of your revenue but also has not grown necessarily every period, also a matter of public record. Does your Growth forecast to 2023 necessitate that -- those large customers keep pace, or can you grow the business to the degree you're talking about? Even if that large one lags and you can grow with others or perhaps substantially increase the total number of customers, particularly in [Indiscernible] And then a follow-up for Trac. Aart de Geus: Well so as you well know, we never comment about an individual customer, certainly not from a business point of view. But I would just highlight that the most advanced customers, the largest customers in the world are also far and away from the most aggressive in technology adoption.  And for good reason, that is why they are the most successful ones and continue to grow. And so, I expect that to be the case for multiple of our top customers. In terms of structural changes, we've had the good fortune to be able to somewhat continually inside of Synopsys, evolve the structure as technologies either gained strength or are better put together with other Aart de Geus: products. And we've continued to do quite a bit of that under [Indiscernible] our COO's leadership. And I think that that has been very effective because not only does the high degree of vitality, it also opens up new doors. And you've seen, for example, out of the design effort, the SLM, the silicon lifecycle management certainly emerge, and a number of other capabilities.  A great example, of course, is DSO because it -- it intersects with really the entire Company. Primarily right now in design because they're -- their results are just fantastic and of very high value.  And so, we will continue in that, in that vein on the field side, there are two. We continue to optimize for the customers driving different technologies and making sure that the coverage is very good. And in many ways, the good news is that despite all the restrictions with Covid, I think we have not really missed any bit and covering the needs of our customers well. And so right now I would consider that Synopsys is in actually a pretty good spot. Jay Vleeschhouwer: Trac [Indiscernible] Trac Pham: Can I just emphasize Aart's comment on the restructuring if I get your question because if you look at the operating margin results over the last few years, we've been increasing it by eight points since a low of 18, right? And so there has been a lot of changes across the Company.  And so, while we have been able to grow that business, reinvest in the business, we're simultaneously making a lot of that change and so there is a good opportunity for us to sustain that going forward. And so, it's not a new skill that we have to acquire, develop. This is something that we have been working on for many years now.  And so, this practice of driving to higher profitability in the next few years is going to be more of the same, but more hard work because we're working off on a pretty high base. With regards to customer concentration, I think a lot of the reality is we're still working on finalizing the budgets for next year and the plans for the next couple of years.  What we are seeing is really strong -- strength across the broad product sets and strength across the broadest -- broad customer base. And there's enough confidence in our ability to execute against that. We feel willing to go out and commit to 5 billion by '23. So, it's very, very much front base. Jay Vleeschhouwer: Okay, now, for Trac, you spoke more positively about [Indiscernible] performance and an outlook. What would seem to collaborate that is, there has been over the last few months a very significant increase in the number of open software security consulting positions you're looking to fill. Q3 over Q2 and there's so fairly, fairly material, including the particular for Asia positions related to CIG. So, have you seen over the last quarter or so, therefore a material increases in the pipelines for say, engagements, and deployments to warrant that kind of opening of the aperture for [Indiscernible]. Trac Pham: Short answer is yes. I might give you some color about how we're thinking about [Indiscernible]. You remember at beginning of the year, we said that we were going to make some changes and to get the business back on a Growth -- Growth path of 15% to 20%. And what we said was, for this current year, we would exit the year at double-digits [Indiscernible] because it will take time for the improvements and bookings to translate to revenue. And that by Q4, our goal is to exit the year in double-digits.  We are now in fact approaching double-digits for the full year, and I just exit. So, I think the momentum clearly has been progressively improving. And I think if you call the tone throughout the year, I think it was kind of cautiously optimistic. We're seeing good progress in an impact on the changes. But one quarter, two quarters, I think it's too early to call it. Four quarters in, it does feel like we're really on the right path and if we continue executing this, the goal of 15-20% growth long-term feels very, very doable.  With regards to the investments, I think the same thing there, we have been progressively feeling positive. And again, if you remember the commentary on operating margins, we saw we would have to invest more this year and then bring margins down in order to drive growth. In fact, the team's done a really good job balancing the changes in the business while managing their investments to keep margins relatively flat.  And so, the hiring that you are seeing certainly reflects an emphasis on hiring in areas where we can get the most impact. And it's just very -- a very disciplined approach in terms of hiring. Overall, just their results support continued investments in that business. But the outlook is very good Growth in next few years, as well as, margin improvements. Jay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you both. Trac Pham: Welcome. Aart de Geus: Thank you. Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Gal Munda with Berenberg, please go ahead. Gal Munda: Hey, thank you for taking my questions. The first one is just I'd like to go back on the full expense of the full-year guidance upgrade and just kind of thinking about it to make sure it's clear. It's not just that you were surprised by the number of hardware orders that you are seeing in Q4, the mix of all different, some business segments that allowed you to raise the guidance by 145 million on the at the midpoint. Is that correct? Trac Pham: That's correct, yes. Gal Munda: Okay. That's it. [Indiscernible] And then just as a follow-up to that, it's a big revenue number to raise with one quarter to go down. But at the same time when I look at the operating cash flow raised again it's just as impressive as it implies more than 50% incremental operating cash margin. So that revenue base. So, can you just talk to me about how much of that is sustainable when you look at the operating cash flow, incremental, versus any one-offs that play and potentially help? This year a little bit because of the fact that it's a little higher than the overall operating cash flow margin that you [Indiscernible] been generating recently. Thank you. Trac Pham: No, overall, both on the PML and the cash flows, I would characterize it as just very good, good results across the board as opposed to being driven by one-time items or any unusual items. But keep in mind the cash flow will be lumpy.  Just given that depending on the day the week that it comes in and can slip from one quarter to next or one year to next. But over the long term, as we continue to drive operating margins up and drive operating income growth. Cash flow should track very well to EBITDA, with fewer cash taxes over time. Gal Munda: Got you. Okay. That's great. Thank you. Trac Pham: You're welcome. Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jason, your line is open. Okay. We'll move on to Pradeep Ramani with UBS. Please go ahead. Jason Celino: Hi, congrats on the Quarter and the guide. I just had a couple of questions on, first on the revenue piece, based on what you are saying, it feels like 1.15 is more of a -- sort of a new base to think about just looking into October and January.  First of all is that true? And then, if we do the math on your 5 billion targets over, let's say, a 2-year period. That implies roughly 1.25 sort of run rate. So, my question really is that -- how -- can we sort of expect just given your sort of broad-based growth you're seeing, can we sort of expect a linear progression to -- from say, 1.15 to 1.25 a quarter over 2 years. Trac Pham: And I wouldn't look at it that way Pradeep. I think you're trying to impart seasonality on a business when there really isn't one. know, our business is very much recurring. 9% of the business with recurring budgets.  It could be a little noisy from quarter-to-quarter action, but overall, I would look at the trend of our multi-year period and focus on what we're describing for the year. And then within the year, we'll give you very, very specific kind of feedback on what that chronic profile can look like. And it will vary. And it doesn't really indicate -- it will vary depending on what the customer requirements are.  And I'll just remind you that last year we had a Q3 and Q4 that was unusual by historical standards. And then this year has trended out to be a little bit more linear. And so, it will vary even within a two-year spend. But over time, as you look at the annual trend intensity is pretty, pretty steady. Jason Celino: Okay. And on the margin front, the Semi's and system design margins are approaching 34, 35%. How can you think about the feeling, if any, 2 margins on the semi side and the progression of margins even simply backing out from your rule of 45, sort of that 10-11% revenue growth rate you're guiding to? Trac Pham: We could choose -- I'm sorry, let me start up and then add some color to it. But we'll continue to look for efficiencies and productivity across all layers of the business. That will include the semi-side and the software integrity. The opportunities are too -- we're spending a lot in total as a Company and so the more dollars that we can put behind projects and initiatives are going to drive the best returns, will continue to do that. There is no reason to not maintain that discipline. That served us well for the last few years because of those investments that we have made.  And as highlighted in our prepared remarks, our function of the big investments that we've made over the last 5-plus years. And so, we want to make sure that we're looking at that business as well to be more efficient. But that does not at all implied that we won't continue with our [Indiscernible]. But we'll do that in a balanced way so that all areas in business are contributing to get growth and profitability improvements. Aart de Geus: Maybe I think can I add something, you can look at it both outside and inside, starting outside. Of course, the semi and the systems industries have great opportunities right now because they are at this age of Smart Everything will actually touch everything. And then some area is going to go very fast and others are more slowly, but it is unavoidable that electronics and within those semiconductors and software will add substantial value to every vertical that it will touch.  And so that is one of the reasons why you see the semiconductor industry do so well and the fact that they are in some areas are shortages may have nothing to do with that because it's certain specific areas.  But in general, it doesn't have to do with the fact that demand is high and higher than the ability to satisfy it. We expect that the market and as we get overtime will stay very healthy for a while. On the inside, we've always said that you need to have a Portfolio of things that are more mature and with more maturity hopefully comes sustainable product, productivity, and margin, and certain things that you have to invest that in and by definition, investing means putting money in.  But on balance, I think that since we communicated to you about 2.5 years or so ago, that we were going after rural 40. We've executed well without and in many ways, I would consider that episode is now over, and now, we have mentioned to you that the whole of 45 is next So the general recipe is clear and the hard work is always hard. But I think we're on a very good track. Jason Celino: Thank you. Aart de Geus: You're welcome. Operator: And the next question comes from the line of John McPeake with Rosenblatt, please go ahead. John McPeake: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Nice work guys. Aart de Geus: Yeah sure. John McPeake: Just along the lines you just mentioned that a lot of your customers are mentioning component shortages. And you do have some hardware that has some components in it. And I just like to ask if you feel like you have secured enough supply to components to share from? Aart de Geus: I think for the time, the answer is yes. We have a sufficient which does not mean that we don't look for every part to see are their alternatives, what's the status, are there going to be some challenges? Luckily enough for us, we bought the most important parts at the right time insufficient of magnitude that for right now we're covered. But right now, is right now, and so we'll keep being very diligent about this. Although I expect that in some areas has the shortages will gradually manage. John McPeake: One thing I've heard is the semi companies don't want to eat their seed corn. So, you could be a priority customer because they can't get, get their designs done without your products. Aart de Geus: We're part of a circle. Absolutely. John McPeake: Right. So, I guess my second one is on get all around. I did see the tape-out at 3 with a customer. Do you see that as the future and relative to your IML enabled solution, things are getting pretty hairy down there? John McPeake: Could you just talk about that maybe as a driver for different segments of the business placing out, timing, I don't know. Aart de Geus: Sure. Let me make three comments. First, is there have been a number of generations of semiconductor transistors playing hours for many years the way to do it. The thought to do Finest was heresy because these were difficult to do and impossible and then they became possible and we moved forward on that.  The way to look at data all around is essentially it's a sophisticated variation on FinFet. And a number of advanced customers and manufacturing partners are clearly investing in this and clearly going in this direction.  And we can absolutely support it all the way from the very beginnings of providing them with tools that allow them to actually stimulate and design individual transistors all the way to our design system, Fusion Compiler comparator is completely capable of handling this. So that's not going to be a problem. The second comment is, what you are referring to when you say new types of the transistor is it, de facto a form of continuation of Moore's Law.  Meaning still smaller transistors, still less powerful, still faster speed. And while Moore's Law has slowed down, I will emphasize it is still continuing. And that too for many, many times was viewed as impossible, but it is absolutely continuing. I would amend it with something which is you also see more talk of now bringing multiple chiplets, or sometimes called tiles, closely together, sometimes on top of other chips and on other pieces of semiconductor.  And to me, that is a mega booster pack to Moore's Law. Because if you cannot do more transistors on a chip, can you do 2 chips closely together? And there are a number of design issues that Synopsys is particularly well equipped for because when you do something in two chips instead of one, the biggest problem is the in-between, right? Which is how quickly can you get the signals from one to the other. And that's why you want to have them very, very closely linked.  We have a complete 3D IC that designs a system for that. And as we see people, your combination of still smaller devices, but now also multiple chips closely together. We will gradually see that growing. So, I'm very encouraged that for the next ten years we still going to see way more complex systems. And in our case towards complexity is a good word. John McPeake: And just one little follow-up there. I mean, you did raise the revenue growth target to double-digits. You don't have to give a number, but EDA is assumed to be raised as well inside of that, is that fair? Aart de Geus: Yes. Trac sort of alluded to the fact that all of our businesses are doing well. And so absolutely, EDA is a very, very big piece of our business. It's the largest piece. And so, you cannot get too double-digit and grow from there. If, if that were a boat anchor. And in this context, it's actually the opposite, EDA is doing extremely well for us. John McPeake: Excellent. All right. Thanks. Thanks [Indiscernible] Aart de Geus: You're. Operator: And the last question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc, please go ahead. Jason Celino: Hey guys can you hear me? I'm just trying this again. Trac Pham: Yes, we can hear you. Jason Celino: Okay, sorry about that maybe in the essence of time, I'll just ask 1. You mentioned you're seeing your customers renew faster than they have ever before. I'm trying to understand this a little bit. Is this because of the products and capabilities that you're adding and they're having to come to the table quicker? maybe market appetite to move faster, go-to-market faster, et cetera? Thank you. Aart de Geus: Well, yes. The answer is yes and yes. Meaning that they see a lot of opportunities because there's a lot of demand for many of these new capabilities. And at the same time, because of the Continued growth in complexity, they have to rely on more reuse of IP blocks, on more automation in the design process. And we are the ones providing that. And so, I'm super enthusiastic about this decade because I can see the value at the end of this journey for so many vertical markets.  Therefore, the economics from the end markets will come down into the systems semiconductor and in our world, because we are the enablers for that. And I'm also super enthusiastic because I feel that many of the investments that we've made have led Synopsys to be at -- just a unique point of new innovation. And having had the opportunity to be part of the early beginnings of automation, we are synthesis many years ago.  I would equate what we are doing right now with AI on not a design step, but a whole design flow to be very, very similar. And therefore, a long-term high impact. And it's just very exciting to feel the push of the technology and the pool of the end-market and having those aligned, I think is just perfect for us. Jason Celino: Okay. Great. Now that's helpful. Thank you. Aart de Geus: Thank you. Aart de Geus: Well, I guess the signifies that we're done for our first thank you as usual, for attending this and for following us. Hopefully, you read out of the discussion and the preambles that we feel that we're in a very strong, solid business situation, but also very excited about the capabilities that are rolling out, and their impact on the future.  And lastly, that we're in a market situation. And the market really needs the capabilities we have. And so that leaves only the word execution to finish on, and that is our job. So, thank you very much. I hope you all stay healthy in a time where unfortunately the delta waves are bigger than anybody expected. Please vaccinate and stay safe. Thank you. Operator: Ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T teleconference, Gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.\",\n          \"Operator: Good morning. Welcome to the Trane Technologies Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lisa, and I will be your operator for the call. The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Zachary Nagle: Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery: Thanks, Zac, and everyone, for joining us on today's call. Let's turn to Slide number three. Before I dive into our quarterly results, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which is the engine behind our differentiated financial performance and shareholder returns. Our strategy is aligned to powerful megatrends, like climate change and the crucial need for climate action. Last week, United Nations released its emission GAAP report 2022, calling for urgent transformation to avoid climate disaster. The report cites critical actions needed, including efforts to scale 0 emission heating and cooling technologies and to decarbonize the food supply chain. That's where Trane Technologies has a unique position to make a difference. We have the technology today to transform tomorrow. We are proud to be leading our industry with aggressive, science-based sustainability commitments, actions and results. Together with our customers, we are dramatically reducing emissions and creating sustainable homes, buildings and cities. Our purpose-driven strategy, relentless innovation and strong customer focus enables us to deliver a superior growth profile through cycles. This, in turn, helps us drive strong margin and powerful free cash flow to deploy through our dynamic capital allocation strategy. The end result is strong value creation across the board for our team, our customers, our shareholders and for the planet. Moving to Slide number four; Q3 was another strong quarter for us across the board. Our innovation leadership continues to win customers at an unprecedented pace, and our bookings level remained extremely high, reflecting strong share gains in virtually every area of our businesses. Organic revenues were very strong, up nearly 20% and our book-to-bill remained over 100% with organic bookings up 8%. Absolute demand continues to be extremely robust. For perspective, year-to-date, organic bookings are 95% of our total revenues for 2021, and we still have the fourth quarter to go. Bookings continue to be particularly strong in commercial HVAC businesses globally. Our global commercial HVAC business is up more than 40% on a two-year stack. Our Americas commercial HVAC business is even stronger, up more than 50% on a two-year stack. Strong broad-based bookings growth over the past seven quarters have driven our backlog to unprecedented levels with backlog of $6.4 billion at the end of the third quarter. We expect backlog to remain at elevated levels well into 2023. Strong execution of our business operating system has enabled us to stay ahead of persistent inflation and deliver over 10 points of incremental price and positive price versus inflation again in the third quarter. Pricing execution is a core competency for us and increasingly important given higher cost to serve customers across the value chain. On our second quarter earnings call, we discussed two temporary plant closures that delayed $120 million in revenue from the second quarter into the second half of 2022, with the majority of the revenues expected to be recovered in the fourth quarter. I'm proud of the way our teams rose to the challenge to accelerate that recovery in the third quarter to meet or exceed our customers' needs. As a result, we successfully recovered $100 million of the $120 million in the third quarter, which is approximately $70 million ahead of our expectations, and we're on pace to deliver the additional $20 million in the fourth quarter. . Our performance through the third quarter has been strong. Booking levels have remained robust. Backlog remains at unprecedented levels. Inflation has been persistent but our pricing execution has more than kept pace. Supply chain remains tight, but are slowly improving. All in, we're confident in raising both our organic revenue and adjusted EPS guidance above the high end of our previous ranges. When you consider that our guidance includes an additional $0.07 of headwind from FX, we're effectively raising our operational guidance for the year by about $0.15 at the midpoint. The secular megatrends underpinning our strategy are only growing stronger. Execution of our high-performance business operating system and our unwavering focus on putting customers first remain at the core of everything we do. Our balance sheet, liquidity position and ability to deliver strong free cash flow provides a robust financial foundation and good optionality for capital deployment. We are well positioned to not only navigate near-term macro challenges, but to thrive as conditions improve. Please turn to Slide number five. As I discussed on the prior slide, both bookings and revenue growth were strong and broad-based in the quarter. America's commercial HVAC was again a standout with organic bookings on a 2-year stack up more than 50%. Continued strong bookings have driven our Americas commercial HVAC backlog to new heights, up more than 70% year-over-year and more than 200% of historical norms. Commercial HVAC revenues were also strong with low teens growth in both equipment and services. In residential HVAC, revenues were robust, up 16% in the quarter. Bookings were down 8%, consistent with our expectations. As bookings continue to normalize towards a GDP plus profile that we see for our long-term outlook. Still, our book-to-bill was 92% in the quarter and backlog remains at historically high levels. We just opened the first half of 2023 order book for our transport refrigeration Americas business in September, and bookings were strong out of the gate, up high single digits for the quarter. Growth is consistent with our expectations as we've been working with customers on slotting throughout the year. Transport refrigeration revenues were very strong, up nearly 60%. Our team has done a terrific job of ramping up operations at the plant that was impacted by extreme weather in the second quarter and accelerating the recovery of delayed Q2 revenues into the third quarter. When we held our Q2 call, we expected the team to recover about $10 million of the $60 million in revenues in Q3 with the balance in Q4. The team delivered the entire $60 million in the quarter, effectively accelerating the recovery of $50 million in revenues into the third quarter and enabling us to meet or exceed our customers' expectations. If we exclude the shift in revenues from the fourth quarter into the third quarter, third quarter revenues were still extremely strong, up more than 40%. We're on pace for significant share gains in 2022, adding to strong share gains the team delivered in 2021. Turning to EMEA. We continue to see strong demand for our innovative products and services that help reduce energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions for our customers despite the challenging macro backdrop. EMEA commercial HVAC orders were up low teens, and revenues were up in the mid-20s, reflecting strong demand across the portfolio, particularly for our thermal management systems, which are 3 to 4x more efficient than conventional heating and cooling. EMEA transport refrigeration orders declined consistent with our expectations, mainly due to tough comps in the quarter. Additionally, we've been carefully managing our order book to mitigate inflationary impacts and therefore, just opened our order book in September for the first half of 2023. Revenues were up high single digits, significantly outpacing end markets. Overall, backlog for the region remains strong, approximately 40% higher than historical norms. In Asia Pacific, commercial HVAC bookings growth continued to be strong, up low teens. The team has delivered organic bookings growth between low teens and low 20s in each of the past 6 quarters. Asia Pacific revenues were strong, up 28%. Similar to transport refrigeration Americas, our team has done a terrific job accelerating the recovery of delayed revenues due to a temporary plant closure from COVID-19-related lockdowns in China in the second quarter. When we held our Q2 call, we expected the team to recover about $20 million of the $60 million in delayed revenues in Q3 with the balance in Q4. The team rallied and delivered $40 million in the quarter, effectively accelerating the timing of recovery of $20 million in revenues into Q3. If we exclude the shift in revenues from the fourth quarter into the third quarter, third quarter revenues were still strong, up mid-teens. Overall, backlog for the region remains strong, approximately 50% higher than historical norms. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris? Christopher Kuehn: Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number six. This slide does a nice job encompassing our overall performance in the quarter, which was strong across the board. Organic revenue growth was up 19%, adjusted EBITDA margins were up 50 basis points and adjusted EPS was up 26%. We delivered robust enterprise growth in both equipment and services, up more than 20% and low teens, respectively. EBITDA and operating margin expansion was driven primarily by strong leverage on volume growth. Pricing remained strong, up more than 10% in the quarter, and price versus inflation was positive on a dollar basis. Productivity continues to be negatively impacted by supply chain challenges driving plant inefficiencies as well as higher costs to serve customers. We also continue to make high levels of business reinvestment to support continued innovation and product leadership across our product portfolio. Organic leverage was strong at approximately 21%. Please turn to Slide number seven. We discussed the key revenue dynamics for each of the businesses earlier in the presentation, so I'll focus my comments on margins. In addition to the items discussed below, each of our segments also continued to make significant investments in our innovation pipeline to fortify our leading brands and drive market outgrowth. In our Americas segment, we delivered solid margin expansion, driven primarily by strong incrementals on robust volume growth. Price offset inflation on a dollar basis but remained a margin headwind. Margins were also negatively impacted by the supply chain challenges and higher costs to serve customers that I referenced earlier. In EMEA, strong volume growth with solid incrementals was more than offset by foreign exchange impacts and continued acute supply chain challenges, which continue to have an outsized impact on productivity in the region. Price versus inflation improved sequentially and was positive on a dollar basis but remained a margin headwind. In Asia Pacific, margins expanded over 300 basis points on robust volume growth with strong incrementals, more than offsetting FX headwinds. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery: Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide number eight. We discussed throughout the call underlying demand for our innovative products and services has never been higher with unprecedented levels of bookings and backlog across our businesses. Relentless innovation, strong brands with leading market positions, customer focus and operational excellence are hallmarks of our market outgrowth over a long period of time. . In the Americas, our commercial HVAC business is driving strong demand and share gains, as demonstrated by our order growth of approximately 50% on a 2-year stack, and we're exiting the third quarter with another quarter of record backlog, up more than 70% year-over-year and more than 200% of historical norms. End markets remain strong with a variety of economic indicators pointing to growth in 2022. Unemployment is low, and indicators like the Architectural Billing Index remained favorable with a reading of over 50 since February of 2021. Demand remains strong in data centers, education, health care and high-tech industrial verticals, where we have strong customer relationships and market positions. Our commercial HVAC business is underpinned by long-term secular tailwinds of energy efficiency, decarbonization and indoor environmental quality. We also see tailwinds from new and ongoing regulatory and policy-related drivers, such as Inflation Reduction Act and education stimulus. Our commercial HVAC business has a lot of runway, and we believe we have the premier franchise to capitalize on significant opportunities that lie ahead. Demand for our residential products remained healthy with a book-to-bill of 92% combined with 16% revenue growth in the third quarter. We expect bookings and revenue to normalize over time and for regulatory and policy-related tailwinds, such as the upcoming SEER change and the Inflation Reduction Act to help buffer potential market declines. Longer term, we continue to see residential HVAC as a GDP-plus business, which makes up about 20% of our portfolio. Turning to Americas transport refrigeration. ACT continues to project solid growth in 2022, followed by a relatively flat 2023, where the market is expected to remain at a high level. We have a diversified portfolio of solutions across a number of vertical markets, which provide opportunities and continued growth prospects through further market penetration and share gains. Longer term, we continue to see transport refrigeration as a GDP-plus-plus business for us. We'll talk more about the transport refrigeration outlook in our topics of interest section. Turning to EMEA commercial HVAC. While we have muted expectations for overall market growth, given the volatile geopolitical backdrop, demand for our leading sustainability-focused solutions remains strong. We continue to see good opportunities for market outgrowth and share gains across the region, and we're seeing great traction and growth across our Thermal Management Systems portfolio. Looking at EMEA transport refrigeration, the market is expected to be down roughly mid-single digits in 2022, primarily reflecting the removal of Russia from the market sizing. Looking out to 2023, we expect the market to be down modestly, reflecting economic uncertainty in the region. We're continuing to work closely with our customers as the market evolves. Turning to Asia; we continue to see strength in data center, electronics, pharmaceutical and health care verticals. Outside of China, the picture is mixed, with varying dynamics country to country. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris? Christopher Kuehn: Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number nine. As Dave discussed at the outset of the call, we are pleased with our execution through the first 3 quarters of the year, and we continue to see slow but steady improvement in our supply chain. Additionally, bookings and backlog continue at high levels, providing us with good visibility into future revenues. All in, we're confident in once again raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance for 2022. We are raising our full year organic revenue growth guidance to between 13% and 14%, up from our prior guidance of 12%, reflecting both stronger price and volume for the year. We're raising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.15 to $7.20, from a range of $7.05 to $7.15, which is an increase of about $0.07 at the midpoint. As Dave mentioned previously, our updated guidance includes an additional $0.07 headwind from FX for the year that we are absorbing in our guidance, which means our core guidance range is effectively higher by about $0.14 to $0.15 at the midpoint. Our full year organic leverage expectations are unchanged at mid-teens. While we continue to see our supply chain slowly improving, it remains challenging and continues to pressure productivity in our plants and drive higher costs to serve customers as we've discussed previously. As a result, we're expecting similar to modestly improved leverage in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter or between 20% and 25%. We expect free cash flow to remain healthy and are targeting 100% of adjusted net income for the year. Depending upon the timing of revenue and shipments as we close out the year, we could see some receivables carry over into 2023, which could modestly impact the timing of our cash conversion. Other elements of our guidance remain largely unchanged. One last item I wanted to highlight relates to our guidance cadence. As Dave discussed earlier, when we raised our guidance on our second quarter call, we envisioned recouping about $30 million of the $120 million in delayed revenues related to the second quarter plant closures in the third quarter, and recouping the other $90 million in revenues in the fourth quarter. We're extremely pleased we were able to accelerate this recovery plan and recoup $100 million in revenues in the third quarter, $70 million ahead of our guidance expectations. The net effect is a modest shift in the timing of $70 million in revenues or approximately $0.07 of adjusted EPS into the third quarter from the fourth quarter, with no impact to the full year. Please see Page 17 of the presentation, which provides additional details related to guidance to assist with your models. Please go to Slide number 10. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation by 2023. We continue to invest in these cost savings in high-ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio. It's important to note that our transformation savings program is a discrete program related to recovering 3x the amount of stranded costs we expected to see as a result of the separation of our industrials business. Our business operating system is designed to drive continued strong productivity and cost savings over the long term, and we have a long track record of success over the past 10-plus years. Our relentless focus on executing our business operating system and driving productivity and cost savings continues long after the discrete transformation program has achieved its targets. Please go to Slide number 11. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to Slide 12, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment in 2022. In the third quarter, we deployed $406 million in cash, with $156 million in dividends and $250 million to share repurchases. Year-to-date through October, the company has deployed approximately $1.6 billion, with $900 million of share repurchases, $467 million dividends and approximately $250 million to M&A., including the acquisition of AL-KO Air Technology, which closed on Monday, October 31. We continue to target the deployment of approximately $2.5 billion of capital in 2022. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and we have significant firepower for share repurchases with approximately $3.5 billion remaining under current share repurchase authorizations. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality and dry powder moving forward. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery: Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide number 14. Overall, global transport refrigeration markets are expected to remain healthy in 2022. Forecast for 2022 are largely unchanged versus the last quarter, with strong growth in North America and a mid-single-digit decline in EMEA, largely driven by the removal of Russia from the market sizing. For 2023, forecast have softened a bit versus the prior quarter. ACT is now projecting roughly flat growth from 2022 to 2023 with the overall market remaining at a high level. In EMEA, while IHS has yet to publish an official outlook for 2023, we expect the market to be down modestly based on a softening European economic backdrop. After clear share gains in truck, trailer and APU in both the Americas and EMEA in 2021, we're expecting continued share gains in 2022. For 2023, we have strong and diversified portfolios in both North America and EMEA and see opportunities for growth and share gains across our portfolio. Please go to Slide number 15. In summary, we are positioned to outperform consistently. Energy efficiency, decarbonization and sustainability megatrends continue to intensify and create record levels of demand for our innovative products and services. We are uniquely positioned to deliver leading innovation that addresses these trends and accelerates the world's progress, supported by our business transformation and our engaging uplifting culture. The strength of our business operating system, the power of our global team and our broad-based market demand gives us confidence in raising our full year revenue and EPS guide. We believe we have the right strategy, the best team and a solid foundation in place to deliver strong performance in 2022 and differentiated long-term shareholder returns. And now we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Dave, can you give us more color into the commercial HVAC bookings environment in the Americas. It looks like your bookings actually accelerated a bit in Q3. Could you talk about the biggest drivers of that bookings growth at this point and the visibility of continued strong bookings? How much of the good growth is the impact from institutional customers, maybe starting to reach day two spend in IQ? Have you seen any customers begin to pull back on spend yet? And are you seeing any major differences between applied and unitary? David Regnery: Yes. Well, we haven't seen any pull back, Andy. Good question. But we're seeing broad-based demand, electronics, data centers, education, health care, high-tech industrial, think of electronics, EV plants, battery plants. So we're seeing some nice demand. I mean our order rates were up around 20% in the Americas, and it's really across many verticals. So a lot of strength there. Andy Kaplowitz: Great. And then maybe a similar question on resi. I know you don't want to give us exact forecast for '23, but bookings down high single digits, in line with what you guys thought. But pricing still very strong. Have you seen any weakness in replacement volume at this point? You kind of said that you didn't expect it to fall off a cliff. How is that going? What about inventory in the channel? And are you still measuring your resi backlog in months that gives you decent visibility, especially with CR change in '23? David Regnery: Yes. Our resi business had a very strong third quarter with strong mid-teens organic revenue growth. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 92%. Channel inventory in our independent wholesale distributor channel was a bit higher than normal, but nothing alarming. Sell-through in the independent channel was mid-teens. So it was strong. Order rates will be under pressure here in the short term as we think about this backlog that we're still measuring in months as it starts to normalize. And Andy, if you remember in 2021, our order rates for our resi business on a full year basis were up around 30%. And our revenue was up like 14%. So we built this really large backlog that we'll need to process through. And you really need to look at -- when you think about residential, we really look at 3 different elements. One is what's your order rate. Two is, what's your backlog and then obviously, the revenue. And those 3 will start to neutralize themselves over time. But longer term, we see our residential business as a GDP-plus business, and they had a very strong third quarter for us. Christopher Kuehn: Andy, I'll add on the enterprise backlog. We reported of $6.4 billion. We still see that 90% is nonresidential. It's focused on our commercial businesses, including thermal, so it will stay the same here in the third quarter. David Regnery: We do not see resi falling off a cliff. There's going to be some positive tailwinds to next year. You have the SEER change that will happen, which will drive some price. You also have IRA, which we're still working through. There's some elements there that still need to be defined. But that will be a tailwind. Hopefully, that starts towards the beginning of the second quarter. So there is some positive too in residential. Operator: We'll take our next question from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh: Congrats on the nice quarter. . David Regnery: Thanks, John. Appreciate it. . John Walsh: I'm going to take a stab at it. So you have incredibly strong backlog. You've opened up the order book at Thermo King, services continues to grow nice just -- anything you can give us in terms of maybe how you think the market develops into '23? Or just how much more visibility you have today than you would normally have going into a year? David Regnery: Yes. I think with the backlog of $6.4 billion, it gives us a lot of visibility. If you think about a normal fiscal year, John, we typically go in with about 20% of our revenue in the backlog. Obviously, we're going to go into 2023 with a much larger number, which really is going to help us, too, with our forecasting capability with our suppliers. The supply base is still constrained. It's improving. The third quarter was certainly better than the second quarter. The fourth quarter will be better than the third quarter. But it is going to be constrained for a period of time. But having that visibility really helps us, helps our suppliers, helps us with our forecasting capability. John Walsh: Great. And then maybe just on the margin. Price cost still positive on absolute dollars. I think you said it's still a headwind to the margin. Just as you think about price flowing into next year, maybe also what you're seeing on inflation, just maybe give us some expectations for price costs and when it flips positive on a margin percent. Christopher Kuehn: Yes, John, you summarized it well. The third quarter price cost positive on a dollar basis, still a margin headwind, but less of a margin headwind in Q3 than what we saw in Q2. So it is getting a little bit better. As we think about 2023, we'll certainly see some carryover price coming into next year. We're seeing those commodities start to come down off of their peaks. Certainly not back where we were two years ago in terms of commodity costs, but a little bit of deflation there. We see that impacting 2023, more so than 2022. But we also are looking at items like wage inflation and energy inflation as well that we'll need to bundle all together, and we'll provide a better look on 2023 in a few months when we report our Q4 earnings. But there should be some deflationary opportunities in there. We're going to have, as Dave mentioned, a very strong backlog entering into 2023. And ultimately, the goal here is to deliver top quartile results. Operator: We'll take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis: If you think back to kind of prior housing recessions, we saw a bit of a double mix shift, a mix shift down to lower end units and a mix shift towards more repair versus replace. What -- given the SEER changes that are coming in, in '23 and perhaps maybe change in kind of how dealers have taken inventory and stuff. What do you -- do you see a similar potential or muted impact? It sounds from your prepared remarks like perhaps a more muted impact, but maybe some color on why would be helpful. David Regnery: Yes. I think it will be a little bit more muted. I think that there's obviously the SEER change, which we are in the process, obviously, of shipping the new products as we speak. So that's going to add some price. It's also going to push up the higher end of the SEER market. I also think that IRA will be a tailwind. Again, we're working through some of the details on that still need to be defined. But that will certainly push the market more to the heat pump side of things and the higher SEERs on the heat pumps. Scott Davis: Okay. And switching gears, I see your releases, press releases plus kind of trade magazines, the next generation of products in Thermo King. Where is that mark -- I mean help us understand kind of the demand from the customer for next-generation product, and in particular, really, where is that technology going? Is it going to a hybrid or all battery and when, I suppose, is another way to add? David Regnery: Good question. We don't have totally the crystal balls there, but I would tell you that it is moving to electrification, okay? You're seeing it in the smaller vehicles now. And we have a complete portfolio of products there that are able to capture that market. On the long-haul carriers, think about the reefer units, that will be a slower transition but we're ready for it. We actually have products that are out now. We're testing in the field with customers that are fully electric. It will take an approach very similar probably to what you've seen with cars where you'll start with hybrid and then it will move to an all-electric version. Operator: We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell: Just wanted to start with the Thermo King outlook. So you've got that very helpful Slide 14. Just when we're thinking about next year, it looks like, as you said, the sort of third-party market forecast and so forth are sort of flat to down units in 2023. So I just wondered about how would you sort of frame the scope for Thermo King overall transport that Trane to do better than that. What's the outlook for that one third of revenue, which is sort of marine, bus, rail and aftermarket? How is pricing in transport for you versus the Trane enterprise? Any thoughts on share gain potential, perhaps after some undergrowth in North America this year? Any sort of color on that, please. David Regnery: Yes. I would say that our Thermo King business, I'll start in the Americas. It's performed very well for a number of quarters consecutively. Very strong quarter, obviously, in the third quarter, as we saw the revenue that we missed in Q2. The team was able to pick that up in Q3, just a great effort there by that team. As far as share gains, we're very happy with our share gains in our Thermo King business. Outlook for 2023, we like the innovation that we've been able to drive in that business in really both regions -- both EMEA and in the Americas. And it's really helping us with those share -- our share position. So 2023 in the Americas, ACT has got a relatively flat to 2022, but understand that's at a very, very high level. They're forecasting the trailer market to be -- the last number I saw was like 45,000, which is a very, very robust market. And in Europe, we haven't seen an official forecast from IHS. We're estimating that it's going to be down modestly, but don't assume that, that means that our business will be down, okay? We have some great innovations there, and we continue to get traction with some of the innovations that we've had in our EMEA business. Julian Mitchell: And Dave, maybe just one follow-up on that. The pricing in transport, how do we think about that versus the Trane enterprise average of, I think, 10 points? Christopher Kuehn: Julian, I'll jump in. We don't really dial it in necessarily by each SBU. But I would say it's certainly contributing to the enterprise performance. The business operating system that's been deployed for many years. One aspect of that is pricing and getting in front of inflation. And the Thermo King team is really a part of that strength that we've shown over the last now 7 quarters in this highly inflationary environment and staying ahead on price cost. So really proud of where our teams both in Americas and Europe and in Asia dealt there. David Regnery: And Julian, if I could just follow up on just a quick story here to talk a little bit about our culture here at Trane Technologies. That team in the Americas overcame a massive obstacle that happened in the early May time period when a tornado hit our facility in Puerto Rico and really removed the roof from one of our major assembly operations there. And I can remember meeting with that leadership team and it was early May, and the President of that business, she walked into the room, and she looked at the team, and she had 3 questions for the team. And she said, number one, are all our employees safe? And the answer was, yes, because the storm hit on a Sunday afternoon and the plant was unoccupied. The second was, do any of our team members need help? And the answer was no because as tornadoes are, they tend to be very targeted, and it wasn't a large impact to the community. And the third question was, how do we get this facility back up and running so we could take care of our customers? And here we are talking about this in the late third quarter, early fourth quarter, and we were able to recover all of the missed revenue that happened in the second quarter and the third quarter. That team performed exceptionally well. And just it speaks volumes to the character of not only that team but to Trane Technologies. Julian Mitchell: That's good to hear, Dave. Maybe just switching tack for a second. Operating leverage, Chris, you called out 20% to 25% for Q4. When we look at just sort of broadly the next 12 months, do we assume that number lifts gradually as you get this kind of steady abatement of price cost and supply chain margin headwinds? There's no kind of step change, but it should clearly move higher from Q4. Christopher Kuehn: Yes, I would say, Julian, the commodity -- the direction where commodities are going would suggest there should be certainly some improvement. We've done some great work staying ahead on price and keeping them ahead of inflation. So I think that is an opportunity going into next year is that price versus direct material cost inflation. We are looking at areas such as wage inflation and energy inflation as well that have to be factored in. So we'll provide more guidance on that in a few months. . We're also going to be -- right now, we're in the middle of that planning process for next year. We're really spending a lot of time around our investments, again, and where can we accelerate some of those investments to really drive returns. So all of that's going to be baked in as we think about incrementals for next year. But a lot of moving components as always, but we'll give you guidance in a few months. Operator: We will take our next question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie: Just going to -- maybe just starting off with maybe just parse out a little bit what's happening here on the margins. You're clearly -- I'm assuming FX, price costs having an impact. It's been down now for 4 quarters in a row. I'm just wondering, at what point do we start to see an improvement in the margin profile for the EMEA business? Christopher Kuehn: Yes, Joe, think of that FX decline on a year-over-year basis, about half of that is coming from foreign currency. The other half of that is still these acute supply chain issues that frankly, we saw in that region starting about a year ago with the significant demand. And we're still incurring higher costs to serve customers, which we know is the right thing to do in this market. But both those costs, the supply chain inefficiencies are just still very real. And then foreign currency are really the drivers for margin. . We do expect those margins to improve over time as these supply chain challenges improve. Dave's talked about this gradual recovery, and we've seen that occur in the third quarter with some stronger volumes than what we had forecasted. And we do see that gradually getting better as we move out over the next several quarters, but it's going to take some time. David Regnery: Yes, John, the other thing I would add is I'm very confident long term with our outlook in Europe. That region continues to grow share and it is one of our leading regions with innovation. So just a really creative management team there that's been able to execute well. And long term, I feel good about Europe. Joe Ritchie: Yes. I guess maybe part of my question, I should have asked it earlier, is like are you starting to see any impact from European energy costs? Like is that impacting the margin at all? Just any color around that would be helpful. Christopher Kuehn: Yes. I'd say maybe a little bit in the third quarter. I mean, certainly, as we talk to our employees, they're feeling the impact of that and their own utility bills and the statements that they're getting at home. Yes, so it's starting to creep in a little bit in the third quarter, a little bit into the fourth quarter and certainly into next year, maybe a bigger dollar amount for us to kind of consider and think about it from a pricing perspective. . I think what it's also doing is driving a fair amount of the order growth as well as you think about products that are in the Thermo King space, hybrid electric products that have 30% fuel savings versus the product that was on the market two years ago, the electrification of heating and driving our thermal management systems on the commercial HVAC side, the reduced energy intensity. Those are really contributing as well in this very challenging energy crisis in Europe. Joe Ritchie: Got it. That's helpful. And if I could just maybe sneak one more in just on resi. Can you parse out just what -- how much of the growth this quarter was price versus volumes? And whether there's been any like discernible difference between what you're selling through your own network versus what you're selling through independent distribution? David Regnery: Well, I think the simple answer there is everything was up mid-teens. So that makes it easy to answer. Yes, I mean, for the enterprise, we had over 10 points of price, and resi continues to be one of our leading businesses with price. So it's north of 10. But we won't go any further than that for competitive reasons, but it's a strong business, had a good strong third quarter. Operator: We'll take our next question from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Gautam Khanna: Nice quarter, guys. I was -- just to follow-up on the last question on resi. I was wondering, are you seeing any signs of double ordering, pushback maybe as lead times come in, you're not getting -- you're getting cancellations or anything of that sort? I'm curious just you haven't given guidance for next year, but do you think resi profits can actually be up next year with volumes down some unquantified level? And if so, kind of why? David Regnery: Yes, I'll start. I'll let Chris talk about the profit next year, but we're not seeing any cancellations, okay? That's not happening. If I look at the inventory in the channel, as I said earlier, it's a bit higher than we would normally see, but nothing alarming, and we haven't seen any cancellations. I do believe that we will see our order rates on a unit basis continue to come down because we have to process through this backlog that is -- it's just -- we're still measuring it in months. And it's going to take several quarters before we're able to process that down. Christopher Kuehn: Yes. I would add on the margins. As we've said, the residential business has really had some very strong price over the last seven quarters. At the same time, stayed ahead of inflation. As we go into our planning process, we look at all of our strategic business units and we think about top line growth, leverage growth, our cash flow performance across the board. I think the team has executed quite well. With investments they've made over several years in the value space, that's a market that continues to grow well for that SBU and depending on how markets move in the U.S. that's an area that Ten years ago, we didn't have very much of a presence in the value channel. That's an area we do have a presence in today. And on the replacement side versus repair, we'll see where that plays out, but it's a business that has a great sense of purpose as well as brand. David Regnery: And I've said this before, but we don't see the residential business falling off a cliff next year. And we don't see margin contraction or large revenue falloffs. Operator: We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa: As your -- the mix of your resi business with furnaces, is that about in line with the industry, call it, like 30% or something like that? David Regnery: Yes, I don't -- I know that -- it's a good question, Steve. I don't have that in front of me. I would tell you that I know that our mix of heat pumps is stronger than the industry. So that would -- and obviously, you don't have a furnace with a heat pump, but I don't have the specifics on heat pumps when we're selling split systems. Steve Tusa: Yes. Okay. And then just on the commercial side, I think you guys put through a pretty dramatic price increase in the third quarter on light commercial, and we're continuing to hear about extended lead times there. Can you just talk about maybe if -- what kind of behavior you saw around that price increase or if I'm wrong about that? And then are you guys seeing longer than normal lead times on your -- on the light commercial side? Christopher Kuehn: Steve, I'll start with pricing. This part of our business operating system is to evaluate the input costs and then ultimately, making sure we're pricing based on value as well. So I'd say, across the majority of our businesses in 2022, we've seen actually three rounds of price increases, very similar to the three rounds we saw in 2021. So yes, I think the team is looking at significant demand, making sure we're pricing for it. A number of these products are being delivered three, six, nine months out, so we want to make sure we're protecting ourselves from an inflation perspective on the cost side. David Regnery: Yes. As far as lead times go, Steve, we have extended lead times across our portfolio as does the broader industry as do most industrials right now as we're still working through the supply chain challenges that are improving. As far as on the unitary side, actually, that's -- we're doing pretty well there. So I don't see that -- that's not an area that we have -- I would imagine that we're very competitive in the marketplace there. Steve Tusa: What was your commercial unitary order up in the quarter? That's my last question. David Regnery: Orders, I'm sorry, in unitary? Steve Tusa: Commercial unitary. Yes, commercial unitary equipment. Christopher Kuehn: I know our revenue was up in the 20s. I don't know what the order rate was. I can -- we'll get back to you on that after the call. . Operator: We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe: Just quickly on the unitary versus applied mix. Obviously, lots of questions about the macro. You applied large commercial feels like it's got a lot of secular tailwinds and it has. Is there -- would you say unitary still has a bit more cyclicality risk than applied? Just a quick question there. But really, my question is really around the services, low teens in the Americas and EMEA, really impressive. I think over time, it's grown 7%, 8%. Is the delta between trend and now mainly price? Or is this IAQ and other things that's driving that growth rate? And kind of like how do you think that trends in '23? David Regnery: Yes. I think if you look longer term at our service business, and let's look over a 5-year period here on a global basis, our service business is up on a compound annual growth rate, high single digits. So that's a business that's very resilient that's performed very well for us. In fact, in 2020, the pandemic year, we were flat to 2019 despite having lockdowns and having difficulty accessing some buildings. So service business is a great business. We have a great operating system around our service business. And today, it represents close to one third of Trane Technologies. So we're very happy with our service business. On the unitary side, we had strong growth in the -- throughout our commercial HVAC business. So it was broad-based in unitary and in applied. So really broad-based in many verticals across the globe. Nigel Coe: Okay. That's great. And then my follow-on is really a quick one on supply chain. One of the companies this morning surprised on supply chain availability issues in the current quarter relative to last quarter. It feels like most companies are talking about supply chain slightly improving. I'm just wondering how you characterize the momentum and you're kind of in the half to get components? David Regnery: Yes, I'd say supply chain performed as expected during the third quarter. We anticipate a gradual improvement through the rest of the year and for several quarters into 2023. The team is -- our team is doing just a great job of managing that. I think this large backlog gives us more visibility as we talked about earlier, which, again, being able to tell our suppliers, what we need, okay, is very important and being accurate with that. And our team has just done a fantastic job there. So supply chain is improving slowly. Slower than any of us want, and we'll continue to see improvement in the fourth quarter here. . Operator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague: Just a couple of loose ends. First, Chris, just back on Europe margins and FX. I typically think of FX, right, being a profit headwind but not a margin headwind. Is there some particular transactional issue going on in Europe beyond just kind of translation effect of dollar strength? Christopher Kuehn: Jeff, it's a good question. Not all the components, raw material purchases in Europe are all denominated in euros. There's certainly components that come in from the U.S. or from Asia. So there are some transactional headwinds here when you think about the declining euro against the dollar. So that's part of the driver. But I totally understand your question, but it is that dynamic of some of the components we buy in currencies other than the euro. Jeff Sprague: And I was wondering also if you guys could kind of take a swag at measuring kind of the productivity headwinds you've absorbed here over the last -- whether it's the year-to-date or since we got into this whole kind of tangled supply chain mess. And how significant have they been to margins in aggregate and just your thought process on being able to reverse some of that as we may perhaps get into the second half of '23? David Regnery: Yes. I think one of the knock-on effects of the supply chain that's inconsistent is productivity, right? So if you think about you're running a factory, and you don't have the right components, you're stopping lines, you're partially building product, you're putting it out in the yard, you're bringing it back on the line when you get the components to retest the product because, obviously, you want to test everything before it gets shipped out to a customer. So it's been disruptive. It's improving, but it's going to improve slowly as the supply chain improves. As far as quantifying it, it's difficult to do right now. I would just tell you that it's going to be slowly improving, and we'll continue to make progress. It's certainly a focus of our teams as to how do we get back to being able to have the productivity we've seen in the past. But the supply chain, the knock-on effect associated with it, it has had an impact in our operations for sure. Jeff Sprague: I'm sorry, just a related follow-up to that, Dave. So if supply chain got better more quickly than expected, do you think you can actually accelerate backlog conversion or the customer at the job site still is not ready, that there really isn't scope to dramatically accelerate backlog conversion? David Regnery: Yes. I think that we're obviously getting with extended lead times, okay? I think the first thing you're going to see as the supply chain improves, you'll see those lead times start to contract back to more of a normal level. But right now, we're obviously, especially on applied jobs, those are specific to a job site. And they're giving us enough lead way. So we're able to hit their expectations. So it's very difficult to accelerate that on the applied side unless the job site suddenly gets pulled forward, which happens, but I wouldn't say it's -- we're not seeing that as the norm right now. . Operator: We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital. Deane Dray: I'm not sure how specific you can get here. But at the outset of the call, you talked about market share gains in virtually all businesses. If we think about that 9 percentage points in volume growth, how much of that might be attributed to share? And again, it's harder at a total company level versus the business unit, but any color there would be helpful. David Regnery: Yes. I mean it is -- I think when you start talking averages and you start getting share to a company level, it's not meaningful. But I would tell you that if you look around the different regions, we like the growth rates we're seeing. We like the innovations we've been able to drive, and we certainly like the order rates that we're seeing and you could see that with our order rates versus maybe some other companies, but we're very happy with the performance. We're very happy with our product management teams being able to really understand customers' insights and being able to have innovations that exceed their expectations. So I expect that to continue in the future. One of the things that we pride ourselves in is the fact that we don't let up on innovation. We don't let up on the dollars that we invest in innovation, and we're going to -- you're going to continue to see that from Trane Technologies well into the future. Deane Dray: Appreciate that. And just as a follow-up. Any update on indoor air quality, healthy buildings initiative you all had kind of drawn the line in the sand and said it would be a 200 basis point lift for 10 years or so. Where does that stand? . David Regnery: Yes. Go ahead, Chris. Christopher Kuehn: Yes. We quantified it last year, Deane, as a 2-point lift on revenues. And then as we moved through the year last year, we just found it was really hard to start bifurcating what was an indoor air-quality order versus maybe a traditional equipment order or a service order. So certainly helped contribute to the growth last year. But as we're seeing significant growth this year, took the full year guide up 13% to 14% organic growth on the full year. Indoor air quality is one of those contributors to customers looking at upgrading their equipment, getting energy savings right earlier, especially where we see energy prices right now. It certainly is a contributor and remaining tailwind. David Regnery: Yes. One of the areas just talk a little bit about is in the education vertical. And I know the funding there with, our education vertical in North America order rates are up year-to-date over 40%, over 40%. So you could see the traction that we're having there. . Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joe O'Dea: I wanted to ask on COGS and just thinking about some of the cost dynamics moving forward. And if you could talk about sort of within the materials exposure, how much material is of COGS? How much of that is raws versus sourced components? And when you think about those cost trends? Or should we see drive supply chain and lower raws contribute to lower component costs as well or strong demand doesn't translate to lower component costs, just to kind of understand some of those moving pieces? Christopher Kuehn: Yes. It's certainly, I guess, all of the above in the mix. We'll -- we're going to look as we go into guidance for next year, trying to just give an update of the componentry of commodity costs versus other costs because that has kind of changed over time. We've described between copper, aluminum and steel, those being each about one third of total, what I call, Tier 1 commodity costs, excluding state refrigerants. And certainly, as I said before, it provides a bit of a tailwind going into next year in terms of where we see those commodity costs going right now. . Certainly, with more volume, there generally is a bit more leverage we can try to get. But in this supply chain environment and the constraints, we're ultimately just trying to manage that quarter-to-quarter and continue to see that getting better. So I guess I'd leave it at that kind of level as we kind of ultimately look to price for next year and ultimately try to get a price cost positive spread for next year. Joe O'Dea: Got it. That's helpful. And then back to the sort of price cost margin dynamic just based on the visibility that you have. When do you see that flipping such that you're positive on the margin side from a price cost angle? Christopher Kuehn: Yes. I expect for the fourth quarter to remain price cost positive on a dollar basis. I think it will still be margin decremental on a year-over-year basis. That price component, though, of the growth in the fourth quarter, that will be lower than the third quarter. We're just comping against stronger price realization from a year ago. Certainly second half of 2021 much stronger than the first half. So I do expect top line price to be less of a contributor in Q4. But we're on track to be price-cost positive for the full year. And ultimately, for the full year, it will be a bit of a margin headwind as well. . Operator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Zach Nagle for closing remarks. Zachary Nagle: Great. I'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call. And as always, we'll be around to take any questions that you might have in the coming days and weeks. And hopefully, we'll see you on the road soon. Everyone, have a great day. Bye. .
